Here, as soon as A has severed the tree in order to\nsuch taking, he has committed theft.\n(b) A puts a bait for dogs in his pocket, and thus induces Z’s dog to follow it. Here, if A's\nintention be dishonestly to take the dog out of Z’s posses sion without Z’s consent, A has\ncommitted theft as soon as Z’s dog has be gun to follow A.\n(c) A meets a bullock carrying a box of treasure. He drives the bullock in a certain direction,\nin order that he may dishonestly take the treasure. As soon as the bullock begins to move,\nA has committed theft of the treasure.\n(d) A being Z’s servant, and entrusted by Z with the care of Z’s plate, dis honestly runs away\nwith the plate, without Z’s consent. A has committed theft.\n(e) Z, going on a journey, entrusts his plate to A, the keeper of a ware house, till Z shall return.\nA carries the plate to a goldsmith and sells it. Here the plate was not in Z’s possession. It\ncould not therefore be taken out of Z’s possession and A has not committed theft, though\nhe may have committed criminal breach of trust.\n(f) A finds a ring belonging to Z on a table in the house which Z occupies. Here the ring is in\nZ’s possession, and if A dishonestly removes it, A com mits theft.\n(g) A finds a ring lying on the highroad, not in the possession of any person. A, by taking it,\ncommits no theft, though he may commit criminal misappropriation of property.\nPage 133 of 178\n(h) A sees a ring belonging to Z lying on a table in Z’s house. Not ven turing to misappropriate\nthe ring immediately for fear of search and detection, A hides the ring in a place where it\nis highly improbable that it will ever be found by Z, with the intention of taking the ring\nfrom the hiding place and selling it when the loss is forgotten. Here A, at the time of first\nmoving the ring, commits theft.\n(i) A delivers his watch to Z, a jeweller, to be regulated. Z carries it to his shop. A, not owing\nto the jeweller any debt for which the jeweller might lawfully detain the watch as a\nsecurity, enters the shop openly, takes his watch by force out of Z’s hand, and carries it\naway. Here A, though he may have committed criminal trespass and assault, has not\ncommitted theft, in as much as what he did was not done dishonestly.\n(j) If A owns money to Z for repairing the watch, and if Z retains the watch lawfully as a\nsecurity for the debt, and A takes the watch out of Z’s possession, with the intention of\ndepriving Z of the property as a security for his debt, he commits theft, inasmuch as he\ntakes it dishonestly.\n(k) Again, if A, having pawned his watch to Z, takes it out of Z’s posses sion without Z's\nconsent, not having paid what he borrowed on the watch, be commits theft, though the\nwatch is his own property inasmuch as he takes it dishonestly.\n(l) A takes an article belonging to Z out of Z’s possession with out Z’s consent, with the\nintention of keeping it until he obtains money from Z as a re ward for its restoration. Here\nA takes dishonestly ; A has therefore com mitted theft.\n(m) A, being on friendly terms with Z, goes in to Z’s library in Z’s absence, and takes away a\nbook without Z’s express consent for the purpose merely of reading it, and with the\nintention of returning it. Here, it is probable than A may have conceived that he had Z’s\nimplied consent to use Z’s book. If this was A's impression, A has not committed theft.\n(n) A asks charity from Z’s wife. She gives A money, food and clothes, which A knows to\nbelong to Z her husband. Here it is probable that A may conceive that Z’s wife is\nauthorized to give away alms. If this was A’s impres sion, A has not committed theft.\n(o) A is the paramour of Z’s wife. She gives A valuable property, which A knows to belong to\nher husband Z, and to be such property as she has not authority from Z to give. If A takes\nthe property dishonestly, he commits theft.\n(p) A, in good faith, believing property belonging to Z to be A’s own property, takes that\nproperty out of B’s possession.

A person is said to make a false document __\nFirstly.__ Who dishonestly or fraudulently makes, signs, seals or executes a document or part of a\ndocument, or makes any mark denoting the execution of a document with the intention of causing it to be\nbelieved that such document or part of a document was made, signed, sealed or executed by or by the authority\nof a person by whom or by whose authority he knows that it was not made, signed, sealed or executed, or at a\ntime at which he knows that it was not made, signed, sealed or executed ; or\nSecondly.__ Who, without lawful authority, dishonestly or fraudulently, by cancellation or otherwise, alters\na document in any material part thereof, after it has been made or executed either by himself or by any other\nperson, whether such person be living or dead at the time of such alteration ; or\nThirdly.__ Who dishonestly or fraudulently causes any person to sign, seal, execute or alter a document,\nknowing that such per son by reason of unsoundness of mind or intoxication cannot, or that by reason of\ndeception practised upon him he does not know the contents of the document or the nature of the alteration.\nIllustrations\n(a) A has a letter of credit upon B for rupees 10,000, written by Z. A, in order to defraud B, adds a\ncipher to the 10,000 and makes the sum 1,00,000, intending that it may be believed by B that Z so\nwrote the letter. A has committed forgery.\n(b) A , without Z’s authority, affixes Z's seal to a document purporting to be a conveyance of an estate\nfrom Z to A, with the intention of selling the estate to B and thereby of obtaining from B the\npurchasemoney. A has committed forgery.\n(c) A picks up a cheque on a banker signed by B, payable to bearer, but without any sum having been\ninserted in the cheque. A fraudulently fills up the cheque by inserting the sum of ten thousand\nrupees. A commits forgery.\n(d) A leaves with B, his agent, a cheque on a banker, signed by A, with out inserting the sum payable\nand authorizes B to fill up the cheque by insert ing a sum not exceeding ten thousand rupees for the\npurpose of making certain payments. B fraudulently fills up the cheque by inserting the sum of\ntwenty thousand rupees. B commits forgery.\n(e) A draws a bill of exchange on himself in the name of B without B’s authority, intending to discount\nit as a genuine bill with a banker and intending to take up the bill on its maturity. Here, as A draws\nthe bill with intent to deceive the banker by leading him to suppose that he had the security of B,\nand thereby to discount the bill, A is guilty of forgery.\n(f) Z’s will contains these words\"I direct that all my remaining pro perty be equally divided between\nA, B and C.\" A dishonestly scratches out B’s name, intending that it may be believed that the\nwhole was left to himself and C. A has committed forgery.\n(g) A endorses a Government promissory note and makes it payable to Z or his order by writing on the\nbill the words “Pay to Z or his order” and signing the endorsement. B dishonestly erases the words\n“Pay to Z or his order” and thereby converts the special endorsement into a blank endorse ment. B\ncommits forgery.\nPage 161 of 178\n(h) A sells and conveys an estate to Z. A afterwards, in order to defraud Z of his estate executes a\nconveyance of the same estate to B, dated six months earlier than the date of the conveyance to Z,\nintending it to be believed that he had conveyed the estate to B before he conveyed it to Z. A has\ncommitted for gery.\n(i) Z dictates his will to A. A intentionally writes down a different le gatee from the legatee named by\nZ, and by representing to Z that he has pre pared the will according to his instructions, induces Z to\nsign the will. A has committed forgery.\n(j) A writes a letter and signs it with B’s name without B's authority, certi fying that A is a man of good\ncharacter and in distressed circumstances from unforeseen misfortune, intending by means of such\nletter to obtain alms from Z and other persons. Here, as A made a false document in order to\ninduce Z to part with property. A has committed forgery.\n(k) A without B’s authority writes a letter and signs it in B’s name certi fying to A’s character, intending\nthereby to obtain employment under Z. A has committed forgery inasmuch as he intended to\ndeceive Z by the forged certificate, and thereby to induce Z to enter into an express or implied\ncon tract for service.\nExplanation 1.__ A man’s signature of his own name may amount to forgery.\nIllustrations\n(a) A signs his own name to a bill of exchange, intending that it may be believed that the bill was\ndrawn by another person of the same name. A has committed forgery.\n(b) A writes the word “accepted” on a piece of paper and signs it with Z’s name, in order that B may\nafterwards write on the paper a bill of exchange drawn by B upon Z, and negotiate the bill as\nthough it had been accepted by Z. A is guilty of forgery ; and if B, knowing the fact, draws the bill\nupon the paper pursuant to A’s intention, B is also guilty of forgery.\n(c) A picks up a bill of exchange payable to the order of a different per son of the same name. A\nendorses the bill in his own name, intending to cause it to be believed that it was endorsed by the\nperson to whose order it was pay able, here A has committed forgery.\n(d) A purchases an estate sold under execution of a decree against B. B after the seizure of the estate,\nin collusion with Z, executes a lease of the estate to Z at a nominal rent and for a long period and\ndates the lease six months prior to the seizure, with intent to defraud A, and to cause it to be\nbelieved that the lease was granted before the seizure. B, though he executes the lease in his own\nname, commits forgery by antedating it.\n(e) A, a trader, in anticipation of insolvency, lodges effects with B for A’s benefit, and with intent to\ndefraud his creditors ; and in order to give a colour to the transaction, writes a promissory note\nbinding himself to pay to B a sum for value received, and antedates the note, intending that it may\nbe believed to have been made before A was on the point of insolvency. A has committed forgery\nunder the first head of the definition.\nExplanation 2.__ The making of a false document in the name of a fictitious person, intending it to be\nbelieved that the document was made by a real person, or in the name of a deceased person, intending it to be\nbelieved that the document was made by the person in his life time, may amount to forgery.\nPage 162 of 178\nIllustration\nA draws a bill of exchange upon a fictitious person, and fraudulently accepts the bill in the name\nof such fictitious person with intent to negotiate it.
