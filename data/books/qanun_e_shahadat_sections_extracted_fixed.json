(c) A is accused of a crime. The fact that, soon after the commission of the crime, A absconded from his house, is relevant under Article 21, as conduct subsequent to and affected by facts in issue. The fact that at the time when he left home he had sudden and urgent business at the place to which he went is relevant, as tending to explain the fact that he left home suddenly. The details of the business on which he left are not relevant, except in so far as they are necessary to show that the business was sudden and urgent. (d) A sues B for inducing C to break a contract of service made by him with A. C, on leaving A’s service, says to A “I am leaving you because B has made me a better offer.

Illustrations Reasonable ground exists for believing that A has joined in a conspiracy to wage war against Pakistan.

Illustrations (a) It is proposed to prove a statement about a relevant fact by a person alleged to be dead, which statement is relevant under Article 46.
