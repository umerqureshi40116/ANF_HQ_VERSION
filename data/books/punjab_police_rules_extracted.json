The Deputy Inspector-General of a range is responsible to the Inspector- General for the administration, training and discipline of the police of his range and for the efficiency of their organisation and operations for the prevention and detection of crime. In the exercise of this responsibility a Deputy Inspector-General will interfere as little as possible with the executive authority of the Superintendents under him, and will permit such modifications of practice and organization to suit local conditions as he may consider advisable, and as the law and these rules allow. He will use his powers of control to secure a uniform standard of efficiency and the fullest co-operation between districts and branches of the force in the circulation of information and in action against criminals. To ensure that efficiency shall not be impaired by undue variation in methods or practice Organization 3 in different parts of the province, Deputy Inspectors-General of ranges and of the Criminal Investigation Department and the Assistant Inspector-General, Government Railway Police, shall maintain close touch with each other by informal meetings and formal conferences.

        "title": "Permanent establishment how fixed",
        "body": "The permanent establishment of a district is fixed on a careful calculation of the actual number of men required for fixed duties plus the percentage approved by Government as a reserve to provide for casualties and training in the various ranks. The establishment of each district is shown in a distribution statement on Form 2.1, issued by the Inspector-General. Rule 2.2 2.2. Fixed duties. (1) The term \"fixed duties\" includes:A. Cantonment and city police. B. Rural police stations and their subordinate posts. C. Headquarter establishment; guards; escorts; specialists (e.g., traffic staff); armed reserves, and mounted police. D. Office and court duties. (2) Under division A the establishment required shall be calculated separately for (1) the investigation and stationhouse staff (2) the watch and ward staff. No general scale can be laid down. In calculating the investigation and stationhouse strength the principles by which the strength of rural police stations is fixed (sub-rule 3 below) shall be followed as far as possible, but additional provision will frequently be necessary for duties such as telephone orderlies, extra clerical staff, detective staff, a permanent lock-up guard, etc. In estimating the beat staff it is necessary to plot out on a map after close study of local conditions, the number of fixed points (other than special traffic points) day and night beats, and patrols required for each town or cantonment. Careful consideration shall be given to economizing men by providing intermittent patrols instead of fixed points of beats, and by providing means of locomotion to enable a few men to cover a considerable area, wherever possible. When the number of beats, etc. has been fixed, the establishment necessary to furnish them shall be calculated on the basis of every man performing eight hours duty in each period of twenty- four hours. On this basis, the necessary calculations can be made for, and rotation of duties fixed between, day and night duties, duties lasting throughout the twenty-four and intermittent duties. Supervision over the watch and ward staff shall be provided at the rate of 1 head constable to every 10 constables; 1 assistant sub-inspector to every 5 head constables and 1 sub-inspector to every 100 constables. No ratio between police and population is prescribed, except that in the case of towns with a population of over 30,000 the total strength of police for watch and ward should not ordinarily exceed one constable to every 450 inhabitants. In each case local conditions, such as the volume of commercial activity, the importance and frequency of fairs and festivals, the general criminality of the neighbourhood and the like must be considered. (3) The strength of rural police stations (division B) is based mainly on the incidence of crime. A normal police station is held to be one registering an average of seventy-five cases a year. For such a police station the minimum staff shall be 1 sub-inspector, 1 assistant sub-inspector, 1 head constable (clerk) and 12 foot constables. In police stations, where crime is very light the number of constables may be reduced to ten. For every fifty cases above the normal figure shown to be the annual average of a police station, the staff shall be increased by 1 assistant sub-inspector and 2 constables. This standard calculation Establishments 11 may be varied for adequate reasons in special cases. The staff of outposts shall be calculated strictly in accordance with the duty it is required to perform. (4) In division C, headquarter establishment shall be calculated in exact detail of authorised posts to be filled. Under this heading shall be included all enrolled personnel of the Lines establishment, instructors, orderlies, of all descriptions, and upper subordinates, who do not come under any other division. Guards shall be calculated at the actual strength required to form each guard, four constables being allotted to each sentry post, the number of constables allotted to each sentry post being fixed in accordance with rule 18.5(5), and a second head constable being provided for each guard which furnishes more than two sentries. The strength required for escorts shall be calculated on the scales laid down in Chapter XVIII in relation to the average demands in the district for treasure and prisoners escorts, other than the escorting of under-trial prisoners to and from the courts. Provision may be made, if necessary, for escorts at sub-divisions as well as at headquarters. The staff of specialists shall include the special detective staff or traffic staff and such other personnel as may be authorized for particular duties not included in any other division. The strength required for traffic duties shall be calculated on the lines prescribed in sub-rule (2) above for watch and ward duties; other special staff shall be calculated in strict accordance with actual duties to be performed. (5) Court and office duties (division D) shall be calculated according to the actual number of posts to be filled both at district headquarters and at sub- divisions and other magisterial headquarters on the scale prescribed by Police Rules or other competent authority. In addition, establishment shall be provided, on the scale prescribed in Chapter XVIII and on the basis of the average daily number, for the escort of under-trial prisoners to and from the courts, and the guarding of such prisoners in court, at district headquarters and all other places where such escorts are permanently required. (6) In the calculation of fixed duties no provision shall be made for reserves, or for reliefs otherwise than as provided in the foregoing sub- rules. Deficiencies in strength of short duration shall be met by curtailment of duties; those of longer duration caused by leave; other than casual leave, resignations, etc., shall be made good from the reserves referred to in rule 2.3 below.

P. 14 Punjab Police Rules, 1934 Volume 1, CHAPTER 2 Inspectors 17 0 0 per day of five hours or per night of four hours. Sub-Inspector 9 0 0 Ditto Assistant Sub-Inspector 5 0 0 Ditto Head Constable 4 0 0 Ditto Foot Constable 3 0 0 Ditto If the duty lasts more than five hours per day or four hours per night, relief will be provided and double rates charged. (3) All sums recovered under this Rule shall be credited to the head XXIII - police collection of payments for services rendered, receipt on account of additional police under sections 13, 14 and 15 of Police Act 5 of 1861 and at the end of the month, recovery shall be made from the treasury on special additional police pay bills for disbursement to the actual police officers, in accordance with the principles laid down in Inspector-General’s letter No. 106-S/95-4-B-27-A, dated the 31st May, 1928, namely that remuneration shall only be given when the extra duties performed involve less than 24 hours’ absence from normal duty. Thus if a constable is deputed to attend a private function, such as a wedding, which involves his absence from normal duty throughout the whole of one working day, say from sunrise to midnight, he will be considered as having performed over-time duty and will be entitled to extra remuneration, but should the duty involve his absence from sunrise to sunset of the following day, he will not be considered as on over-time duty and will be entitled to no remuneration in addition to his pay. Superintendents may, however, use their discretion in dealing with cases in which, in their opinion, the 24-hour rule cannot in fairness be applied. (4) In deciding when to supply police at the public expense, and when to charge the promoters of a particular function, Superintendents shall be guided by the general principle that the regular police establishment is required to perform all the duties of maintaining public order, which fall within scope of section 31 of the Police Act. When special arrangements are necessary or desired over and above those which the general public interests demand, the person or persons responsible for the assembly concerned should pay for additional police. The law does not permit of compulsion being exercised in this matter, but Superintendents may tender their advice and indicate that no more police than are necessary to prevent obstruction to the general public will be provided unless paid for. Note:- Government has ordered that \"if any sect requires, in religious processions organized by them, the assistance of the police to maintain order, to such an extent as to necessitate extra expenditure by bringing a larger police force together, or otherwise, the cost should invariably be charged to the persons requiring the extra police protection and the same should be paid before the procession is allowed to take place\" (Home Department No. 1073 of 14th March, 1878). This order does not mean that charges shall be levied for the supply of police to processions of ancient and regularly exercised custom in cases where the supply is not in excess of that given for a series of years, and the practice has been to give such supply for a long period without charge.

Indents shall be prepared by tables as shown in the Equipment Tables of Civil Police and Jails, and separate indent sheets shall be used for each of the Ordnance Sections, the last sheet only being signed. For example, one indent only is necessary for stores in table 2, but a separate sheet should be used for each Section shown in the table from which articles are required, as B-1, B-2, B-3, B-4, and C-1 and so on. (2) Indents may be either for first issues or replacement. Indents for first issue shall be submitted only when an increase of establishment or a duly authorized change in the sanctioned scale justifies them, and in each such case the authority shall be quoted. Replacement indents shall ordinarily be submitted annually in the first week in December to the Deputy Inspector- General, who will countersign and forward them to the Chief Ordnance Officer so as to reach the latter officer on or before the Ist January, but if immediate replacement is required, as in the case of an unserviceable weapon, or when the stock of a particular component is exhausted, a special indent may be submitted through the same channel at any time.

(2) Officers of the Indian Police Service may keep, without licence, one revolver or one pistol of non-service pattern, in addition to the revolver prescribed in rule 6.5(1) supra, as part of their equipment (vide letter No. 9/75/50-Police (1), dated 11th April, 1951, from the Under-Secretary to the Government of India, Ministry of Home Affairs, New Delhi, to the Home Secretary to Government, Punjab). The revolvers issued to Gazetted Officers and Non-Gazetted Officers as a part of their equipment are the property of Government and consequently exempt from licence. (3) Presentation of guns and other arms by the police for good work in criminal cases will be made only under the orders of the Provincial Government. Such arms are thus ex114 Punjab Police Rules, 1934 Volume 1, CHAPTER 6 (i) Fold the gauze as in diagram so that the longer sides take the form of an \"S\". (ii) Open the front loop of the pullthrough and put one side of it in each loop of the \"S\". (iii) The coil each half of the gauze tightly round that portion of the cord over which it is placed until the two rolls, thus formed, meet. The gauze must be thoroughly oiled before use and care taken to ensure that there are no lose strands of wire which may scratch the bore, the guaze will fit the bore tightly and will, if necessary, be packed with a small piece of flannelette, or other soft material to ensure it so fitting. The gauze wire should not be allowed to remain on the pullthrough. Oil - Service oil is carried in the oil bottle for which a recess in the butt is provided. No other form of lubricant is to be allowed to remain in the bore. Paraffin, though an effective agent in removing rust, will not prevent it. Stick Cleaning Chamber - Made of wood about a foot long, at one end a slot is cut, the other end is cut square to allow a grip to be taken and the stick to be turned by hand. A piece of dry flannelette is placed in the slot and wound round the stick (to ensure that the stick is covered). The stick is then passed through the bolt way into the chamber and turned round several times. This is the only effective method of cleaning the chamber. Cleaning - Before firing - All traces of oil will be removed from the bore and the action wiped with an oily rag. After firing - (i) Remove the bolt. (ii) Pour about 5 to 6 pints of boiling water through the bore from breech to muzzle, using a funnel, point inserted into the chamber. (iii) Insert the weight of pullthrough through the bolt hole of body then draw straight the barrel from breech to muzzle in one continuous motion. The rifle to be held by the left hand with the toe of the butt on the ground, and the barrel in line with the direction of pull to avoid the cord rubbing the side of the muzzle, otherwise it will cause a groove to be worn where it rubs against muzzle; this is known as \"cord-wear\" and affects accuracy and serviceability. (iv) To be repeated as (iii) until the rag is removed without signs of fouling on it. (v) Clean the breech with a stick cleaning chamber. (vi) Wipe over the face of butt, clean gass escapes and bayonet boss. (vii) If bayonets have been fixed during firing the bayonet will be carefully wiped before it is returned to the scabbard. All metal parts to be carefully wiped over and oiled. (viii) The barrel to be pulled through with a piece of oily flannelette. The bore will be found to require special care during the three days following firing:For buckshot or when necessary to remove bad \"leading\" or rust:(i) To be treated with boiling water as already detailed. (ii) The pullthrough to have an oiled gauze wire 4\" x 11⁄2\" attached. Insert weight through the boltway of body (care being taken to ensure the gauze enters chamber correctly and does not jam) and draw straight through the barrel from breech to muzzle. To be repeated if necessary by packing the gauze, until all \"leading\" or rust is removed. (iii) Followed by a piece of dry flannelette and then an oily piece in the usual way. INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE CLEANING OF.303 RIFLES Arms and Ammunition 115 (a) Cleaning Materials - The pullthrough, which will be kept in the butt trap of the rifle, is provided with three loops. The first loop (the one nearest the weight) is for the wire gauze, the second for the flannette, and the third for the purpose of removing the pullthrough should it break or get jammed in the bore. If a jam occurs no attempt should be made to remove the obstruction, but the rifle should be taken to the armourer. (i) The pullthrough will be drawn through the barrel from breech to muzzle in one continuous motion. (ii) The cord must be drawn straight through and not allowed to rub against the muzzle of the bore, otherwise it will cause a groove to be worn where it rubs; this is known as \"cord wear\" and affects the accuracy of the rifle. (b) Flannelette:- No other form of material will be used for cleaning the bore. For cleaning the bore (or for drying it) after firing a piece of flannelette large enough to fit the bore tightly, 4 inches by 2 inches, will be used. It will be placed in the second loop of the pullthrough and wrapped round the cord. For oiling the bore a slightly smaller piece of flannelette will be used. If the piece used is too big, the oil will be scraped off as it enters the bore. The oil should be well rubbed, with the fingers, into the flannelette. (c) Stick Cleaning Chamber, made of wood about a foot long; at one end a slot is cut, the other end is cut square to allow a grip to be taken and the stick to be turned by hand. A piece of dry flannelette is placed in the slot and wound round the stick (to ensure that the stick is covered). The stick is then passed through the boltway into the chamber and turned round several times. This is the only effective method of cleaning the chamber. (d) Wire Gauze, in pieces 21⁄2 inches by 11⁄2 inches, is supplied, but should only be used with the permission of an officer for the purpose of removing hard fouling or rust. Daily cleaning - The exterior of the rifle will be cleaned daily and all particles of dirt or dust removed from the gas escapes and crevices. The frictional parts will be kept slightly oiled. The bore will be pulled through with a piece of flannelette until the rag is clean, and immediately re-oiled. Cleaning before firing - All traces of oil will be removed from the bore, and the action wiped with an oily rag. The cartridge and chamber will on no account be oiled before firing, nor will any lubricant be used with a view to facilitate extraction, as such a procedure is liable to injure the rifle. Cleaning after firing (i) Remove all fouling and grease from the bore. (ii) Pour about 5 or 6 pints of boiling water through the bore from breech to muzzle, using a funnel. (iii) Thoroughly dry the bore and proceed to clean the rest of the rifle, thus allowing the bore to cool. (iv) The breech will be cleaned with a stick cleaning chamber. (v) Special attention will be paid to the face of the bolt, gas escapes and bayonet boss. (vi) If bayonets have been fixed during firing, the bayonet will be carefully wiped before it is returned to the scabbard. (vii) All metal parts will be carefully wiped and oiled, after which the barrel will be 116 Punjab Police Rules, 1934 Volume 1, CHAPTER 6 pulled through with a piece of oily flannelette. The bore will be found to require special care during the three days following firing. (viii) On active service, where boiling water is not normally available the wire gauze will be used. (ix) Care must be used to prevent the browning from being rubbed off the rifle, as this is a great preventive against rust. Cleaning after firing blank - After firing blank ammunition, special care should be taken that the cleaning is thorough. Although in this case there is no friction between bullet and bore, and so no internal fouling or \"sweating\", there is greater accumulation of superficial fouling from blank than ball cartridge, because there is no bullet in blank ammunition to scour the fouling left by the preceding round. The firing also is in most cases more prolonged, and a greater interval must usually elapse before the rifle can be thoroughly cleaned. When blank firing precedes practice with ball, the rifles will be carefully cleaned before ball practice commences. General notes on care of rifle (a) When the rifle is not in use, the leaf and slide of the backsight should be lowered. (b) The mainspring should never be allowed to remain compressed except when the rifle is loaded. The position of the cocking-piece shows whether the mainspring is compressed or not. (c) The magazine must not be removed from the rifle except for cleaning or other special purpose and, to avoid weakening the spring, cartridges should only be kept in it when necessary. A failure of the spring to raise the platform can usually be overcome by tapping the bottom of the magazine smartly with the palm of the hand. If the failure recurs, the rifle should be taken to the armourer for examination and repair. (d) The bolts of rifles are not to be exchanged. Each bolt is carefully fitted to its own rifle, so that the parts which take the shock of the explosion have an even bearing, and the use of wrong bolt may affect the accuracy of the rifle. The number stamped on the back of the bolt lever should agree with that stamped on the right front of the body. (e) No head constable or constable is permitted to take to pieces any portion of the action, except as prescribed for cleaning, nor is he to loosen or tighten any of the screws. 118 Punjab Police Rules, 1934 Volume 1, CHAPTER 6 with adjacent dates of the same make provided that the group of dates does not exceed 50 boxes and that the dates do not cover a period of more than 14 days. Note 2:- The sample will be taken from an opened box if available. If the result is satisfactory the whole group will be sentenced serviceable. If the result is not satisfactory the sentence will only cover the actual box from which the rounds have been taken and a fresh box will be opened and treated as the sample for the group. Category B. - Loose rounds on charge, other than those obviously doubtful from handling and carriage in pouches, will generally be treated as one group. Representative samples will be examined and 40 fired and the ammunition sentenced as for category A. If there is a large number of loose rounds on charge and some have obviously been subjected to worse treatment than the others they should be bulked into groups according to \"condition\", each group being tested and sentenced separately. 2. The foregoing is intended to apply particularly to M.H. Rifles and B.L. 476 bore ammunition. 3. Special Instructions for examination of B.L. \".410\", \".303\" and \".455\" revolver ammunition. (a) The instructions in paragraph 1 apply also to the above mentioned ammunition with the following exceptions:The casualties that may occur are missfires, hang-fires, pierced caps, blow-backs, burst cases or spilt cases. A blow-back is an escape of gas between the cap and the wall of the cap chamber, if serious, it will be indicated by an escape of gas from the gas escape hole on the left of the barrel body at the moment of firing. The base of the cartridge case will be badly blackened by this casualty. A burst case is a fracture either at the base or within 11⁄2 inches of the base of the cartridge case. Fractures further forwarded on the case body are known as splits and if only occasional may be ignored. Bursts are to be regarded as serious casualties. 4. When in doubt as to sentence, the matter should be referred to the Chief Ordnance Officer at the nearest Arsenal who will arrange for such tests as may be necessary and advise accordingly, or in case or further doubt, refer to the Inspector of Ammunition, Kirkee. 5. Storage - Boxes containing S.A.A. should be kept raised a few inches from the floor by supporting the bottom layer on battens or other suitable supports; they should also be kept a few inches clear of the wall. The store room should be kept clean and dry, ventilation receiving due attention. Tin plate linings should not ordinarily be opened until the ammunition is required for use or test.

A.B. __________, do hereby certify that I have examined C.D. __________ and that I consider him fit to resume his duties in Government Service\". The Officer shall produce the original certificate and statement of the case on which the leave was granted or extended before the authority asked to grant a certificate of fitness to return to duty. In the case of Gazetted Officers this certificate must be signed by a Civil Surgeon or Medical Officer of commissioned rank. If the leave has been sanctioned on a certificate granted by a Medical Committee the certificate of fitness to return to duty must also be obtained from a Medical Committee except (1) in cases in which the leave is not for more than three months, or (2) in cases in which the leave is for more than three months, or leave for three months or less is extended beyond three months but the Medical Committee granting the original certificate or the certificate for extension state at the time of granting such certificate, that the Government servant need not appear before another Committee to obtain the certificate of fitness to return to duty. No travelling allowance will be paid to an officer for journeys performed by him to appear before a Medical Committee to obtain a certificate of fitness to return to duty. In the case of subordinate Police Officers the authority which granted the leave has discretion to admit a certificate by any registered medical practitioner. (b) All applications for leave, or for extensions of leave, shall be made through proper channel to the authority competent to grant the leave. The form of application shall be, in the case of gazetted officers A.F. No. 74, and in the case of subordinates Police Rules Form 8.4(b). Nothing in this rule shall debar a Superintendent of Police from requiring those police officers subordinates to him, who are in a position to do so, to apply verbally for leave in office or orderly room. When prescribed forms are not available, applications may be made by ordinary letter. (c) Gazetted officers applying for leave, or extension leave, on medical certificate, are required to appear before a medical board, in accordance with the provisions of Chapter XI of Punjab Financial Handbook No. 2, Volume II. Subordinate police officers are required to support applications for leave on medical certificate by the certificate of the Civil Surgeon of the district in which they are serving. Applications for extension of such leave must ordinarily be similarly supported by the certificate of the Civil Surgeon of the district where the applicant is residing while on leave. If the applicant for an extension of leave is incapacitated by illness from appearing before the Civil Surgeon, it is within the discretion of the authority empowered to grant the leave to accept the certificate of any registered medical practitioner. The grant of a medical certificate is not equivalent to the grant of leave and confers no right to leave; the certificate must be forwarded to the authority competent to grant leave, whose orders must be awaited. Except on strong grounds, leave recommended in the certificate of a competent medical authority should be granted. (d) A police officer returning from leave is not entitled as of right to resume the post which he held before going on leave unless the order granting him leave specifically preserved his lien on such post. He must report his return to the authority Leave 137 which granted his leave and, unless orders of posting have already been conveyed to him, await orders. (e) A police officer holding a temporary post may be granted leave, within the limits allowed by rule 16.2 Punjab Financial Handbook No. 2, Volume II, provided he has held such temporary post for at least two years or, if he has held such post for less than two years, provided no extra expense to Government is involved. Probationary police officers may be granted such leave as would be admissible to them under these rules if they had been confirmed in their appointments; but leave to probationers while undergoing instructions will only be granted in cases of special urgency.

(2) The Inspector-General of Police may, with the previous approval of the State Government, compulsorily retire any Police Officer, other than that belonging to Indian Police Service or Punjab State Police Service, who has completed ten years’ qualifying service, without giving any reasons. An officer who is so compulsorily retired will not be entitled to claim any special compensation for his retirement. Note 1. - The right to retire compulsorily shall not be exercised except when it is in the public interest to dispense with the further services of an officer, such as on account of inefficiency, dishonesty, corruption or infamous conduct. Thus the rule is intended for use (i) against an officer whose efficiency is impaired but against whom it is not desirable to make formal charges of inefficiency or who has ceased to be fully efficient ( i.e., when an officer’s value is clearly incommensurate with the pay which he draws) but not to such a degree as to warrant his retirement on a compassionate allowance. It is not the intention to use the provisions of this rule as a financial weapon, that is to say, the provision should be used only in the case of an officer who is considered unfit for retention on personal as opposed to financial grounds; (ii) in cases where reputation for corruption, dishonesty or infamous conduct is clearly established even though no specific instance is likely to be proved. Note 2. - The officer shall be given an adequate opportunity of making any representation that he may desire to make against the proposed action, and such representation shall be taken into consideration, before his compulsory retirement is ordered. In all cases of compulsory retirement of enrolled police officers, the Inspector-General of Police shall effect such retirement with the previous approval of the State Government in accordance with the instructions, if any, issued by the Government on the subject from time to time. (3) The officer, whose duty it would be to fill up the appointment if vacant, shall record his orders on the application to retire, which, if in vernacular, should be accompanied by a translation in English.

Gratuities, and not pensions, are granted, and except in very exceptional circumstances, the equivalent of six months pay of the deceased is the maximum admissible. Yearly grants may be made for a limited period to defray the expenses of educating children. Relief from the fund is ordinarily confined to the familites of non-gazetted officers, and preference is given to cases of men on low rates of pay. The deceased officer must have been a meritorious Government servant and preference will generally be given to the dependents of an officer who has died after many years of service and has just failed to draw pension. Death due to special devotion to duty establishes a strong claim. (2) Applications for the grant of compassionate gratuities should ordinarily be made within six months of deaths. They should invariably be accompanied by the descriptiveroll in duplicate (on separate sheets) of the applicants, as the case may be, in Form 9.20(2) duly attested by two or more persons of respectability in the town or village in which the applicant or applicants reside.

In cases of acquittal on other grounds the appellate or revising authority has discretion to prescribe the proportion of pay and allowances, which shall be granted. In cases of honourable acquittal the period of suspension or dismissal will be treated as a period spent on duty. In other cases it will not be treated as a period spent on duty unless the revising or appellate authority so directs. Leave may not be granted to a Government servant under suspension.

(3) The grant of allowances under the preceding sub-rules ordinarily requires the prior sanction of Government in the Administrative Department, if extra cost to the State is involved. In cases, however, where it does not exceed Rs. 500, and where the period during which the Government servant has remained unemployed through suspension or dismissal does not exceed six months, the excess expenditure may be admitted on the sanction of the suspending authority, or the revising or appellate authority as the case may be.

Police Officers of all ranks are amenable to these rules, subject to such further conditions as are imposed by Police Rules. (2) Gazetted Officers and clerks, who have to deal in any capacity, with applications for leave, are required to be familiar with, and are in position to refer to Volumes I and II of Punjab Financial Handbook No. 2, which contain the rules mentioned in sub-rule (1).

In all doubtful cases or where detailed information is required, the rules should be consulted in original. Clerks and others having access to the full rules are required to give all reasonable assistance to officers of whatever rank, who wish to ascertain their individual rights and obligations in respect of leave, or to obtain guidance for dealing with requests received from their subordinates. Note:- Certain Officers have exercised the option, given to them at the time when the Fundamental Rules came into force of remaining under the leave rules to which they had previously been subject. The leave of such officers will not be regulated by Fundamental Rules, but they are, equally with others, amenable to special departmental rules regarding leave. Rule 8.2",

They shall sign an acknowledgment for this amount in the prescribed column of the cash distribution register, and shall receive at the same time from the accountant all the bills, vouchers and acquittance rolls necessary for the purpose of disbursement. They shall be responsible for conveying the cash so drawn, under adequate safeguards, to the lines and police stations and for its safe custody pending disbursement; and that payment is made in correct amounts and to those individuals only, who are entitled to received such amounts. (ii) Cash orders and money orders shall be received from the treasury by the accountant, who will be responsible for despatching them to their correct destinations together with the necessary Advice Notes. Cash orders will be sent through the issue branch of the vernacular office, for entry in the despatch register. Letters of credit will be despatched direct by the District Treasury Officers to the Tehsildars concerned in accordance with para 316 of the Sub-Treasury Manual. The treasury officer will, however, send an intimation to the drawing officer showing the number and date of the letter to enable the Accountant to complete the cash distribution register and advice notes. (iii) In every district according to local conditions a system shall be laid down on a permanent basis by which each police station may obtain and remit money with as little risk and inconvenience as possible, and by which the necessity of utilising special escorts for cash remittances may be minimised. According to 184 Punjab Police Rules, 1934 Volume 1, CHAPTER 10 this system cash required by police stations should be drawn by means of letters of credit on the nearest sub-treasury. (iv) On receipt of an Advice Note the officer to whom it is addressed shall, on the earliest possible occasions, receive the money which he is authorised to draw from the treasury or sub-treasury, personally if possible, and otherwise through a representative specially accredited on each occasion in writing and not lower in rank than a head constable. On receipt of the money drawn from the treasury, the total amount shall be entered in the police station account register No. 20 (rule 22.71) and the money and connected papers shall be placed in the store room pending disbursement. (v) Special escorts may not be sent in charge of cash, if the salaries of the escorts for the time spent on such duties would exceed the commission to be paid if the sums were sent by money order. In such cases, or where other arrangements are inconvenient or unduly expensive, money may be remitted by money order through the treasury, by means of a \"per contra transfer\" to the Post Office in the Treasury Account, the commission, if debitable to Government, being charged to miscellaneous contingencies. When money is sent by money order, the connected papers will be forwarded by post. So far as may be possible, however, money shall be received or remitted through escorts proceeding in the required direction with other duties. (vi) Money received in police stations for credit to Government shall be paid into the nearest sub-treasury on the earliest possible occasion, the treasury receipt being sent at once to the Superintendent of Police. When money received in a police station for disbursement cannot be disbursed within one month owing to the absence of the payee, it shall be returned to headquarters or forwarded to any other police officer who may be in a position to make the disbursement, under invoice of a road certificate. (vii) The accountant shall not be a disbursing officer except to the extent permitted by clauses (i) and (ii) above. The accountant will receive cash only in recoupment of his permanent advance or for immediate credit to the treasury or the cash chest account. (viii) Sums not exceeding a few annas may be remitted by means of postage stamps. Money should not ordinarily be sent in the form of Government Currency Notes by registered or insured posts, except in the special cases in Dera Ghazi Khan. No money shall be drawn from the treasury unless required for immediate disbursement. (Article 88, Civil Account Code, Volume I).

Lists A, B, C and D shall be maintained in each district as prescribed in rules 13.6, 13.7, 13.8 and 13.9 and will regulate promotion to the selection grade of constables and to the ranks of head constables and Assistant Sub- Inspector. List E shall be maintained in the office of Deputy Inspector- General as prescribed in sub-rule 13.10(1) and will regulate promotion to the rank of Sub-Inspector. List F shall be maintained in the office of the Inspector-General as prescribed in sub-rule 13.15(1) and will regulate promotion to the rank of Inspector. Entry in or removal from A, B, C, D or E lists shall be recorded in the order book and in the character roll of the police officer concerned. These lists are nominal rolls of those officers whose admission to them has been authorised. No actual selection shall be made without careful examination of character rolls. 1[Provided that five per cent of such promotions may be made from amongst the members of the Police Force, who achieve outstanding distinction in sports field at All India level or International level if they are otherwise eligible for promotion but for seniority.] Rule 13.2",

        "title": "Use of force against crowds",
        "body": "(1) Instructions regarding the use of force by the police against crowds are as follows:The use of force by the Police is regulated entirely by the provisions of the law. Those provisions are contained in Chapter V (especially Sections 46 and 50), and Chapter IX (especially Sections 127 and 128) of the Criminal Procedure Code. (a) The main principle to be observed is that the degree of force employed shall be regulated according to the circumstances of each case. The object of the use of force is to quell a disturbance of the peace, or to disperse an assembly which threatens such disturbance and has either refused to disperse or shows a determination not to disperse; no ulterior objects, such as punitive or repressive effect, shall be taken into consideration. (b) Any officer in charge of a police station or police officer of higher rank has power, independently of the authority of a Magistrate, to call upon an unlawful assembly to disperse and to use force to disperse it. (See Section 127, Criminal Procedure Code). When a Magistrate (other than an honorary Magistrate) is present or can be communicated without such delay as would prejudice the situation, an assembly shall not be called upon to disperse nor shall force be used to disperse it without orders of such Magistrate, provided that, if a gazetted police officer is present, and no Magistrate having first class or higher powers is present, such police officer shall act independently in ordering an assembly to disperse. In other circumstances the senior police officer present, having the powers of an officer-in-charge of a police station, shall act on his own responsibility, but shall communicate with and report his action to the senior Magistrate, who may be accessible, as soon as possible. Whether acting under the orders of a Magistrate or not, once the order to disperse a crowd has been given, the method by which force shall be applied and the degree of force to be used shall be decided by the senior police officer present; provided that, if the District Magistrate is himself present, he, as head of the police force of the district, shall be recognised to be the senior police officer present. For the purposes of this rule a Sub-Divisional Magistrate within his sub-division shall have the status of a District Magistrate, i.e., he shall be recognised by all police officers of the sub-division as the senior police officer, and shall have power to decide the method and degree of force to be used. (c) All attempts to disperse a crowd by warnings, exhortation, etc., shall be made before it is declared an unlawful assembly and, as such, ordered to disperse. Once an order to disperse has been defied, or when the attitude of a crowd is obviously defiant, force shall be used without hesitation. The degree of force used shall be the minimum which the responsible officer, with the exercise of due care and attention, decides to be necessary for the effective dispersal of the crowd and the making of such arrests as may be desired. The degree and duration of the use of force shall be limited as much as possible, and the least deadly weapon which the circumstances permit shall be used. (d) The effectiveness of force depends mainly upon the determination with which it is applied; its direction against the most defiant section of the crowd to be dispersed and its absolute control. Failure to act on this principle results inevitably in more force being applied and more dangerous weapons being used than would otherwise have been necessary. It is not possible to lay down any more definite rule as to when different methods or different weapons shall be used. The officer responsible is required to decide this in each case on consideration of the strength and attitude of the crowd to be dispersed, and the strength of the force available for its dispersal. 430 Punjab Police Rules, 1934 Volume 2, CHAPTER 14 (e) When the responsible police officer, whether acting under the orders of a Magistrate or independently, considers that the use of firearms is necessary, he shall, unless circumstances make such action impossible, warn the crowd that if they do not immediately disperse, fire with live ammunition will be opened upon them. If the District Magistrate or, in a sub-division, the sub- divisional officer is present, his orders shall invariably be obtained immediately the necessity of opening fire becomes immnient. If the senior police officer present is of non- gazetted rank, he shall at such stage obtain the orders of the senior Magistrate present (other than an honorary Magistrate). (f) In order that the decision to open fire may be promptly acted upon without loss of control or confusion, the responsible police officer shall, as soon as it appears likely that the use of firearms will be necessary, tell off a detachment of armed police to be held in readiness. When fire is to be opened, the responsible police officer shall decide the minimum volume necessary to be effective in the circumstances and shall give precise orders accordingly, as to the particular men or files who are to fire and the number of rounds to be fired; and whether volleys or independent aimed shots are to be fired, and shall ensure that his orders are not exceeded and that no firing contrary to or without orders takes place. Whatever volume of fire is ordered, it shall be applied with the maximum of effect; the aim shall be kept low and directed at the most threatening parts of the crowd; in no circumstances shall firing over the heads of or at the fringes of the crowd be allowed. Since buckshot is not an effective charge at any range at which it is safe to use it, Government has directed that the use of buckshot ammunition against crowds should be prohibited. (g) When no Magistrate is present, the police officer in command, as is contemplated in the Criminal Procedure Code, shall be responsible for the opening of fire. Invariably, whether the order to use firearms has been given by a Magistrate, or by a police officer, the order to cease fire shall be given as soon as the unlawful assembly shows a disposition to retire or disperse. (h) While the disposition of the police must be left to the police officer in command, every precaution should be taken that a force armed with firearms is not brought so close to a dangerous crowd, as to risk its either being overwhelmed by numbers or being forced to inflict heavy casualties. If the use of firearms cannot be avoided, firing should be carried out from a distance sufficient to obviate the risk of the force being rushed and to enable strict fire-control to be maintained. (i) On occasions of religious festivals police carrying firearms should ordinarily not be employed to escort processions. They should be posted in front or in the rear of the procession where they are in least danger of being thrown into confusion by the mob and can be kept under the control of the officer in command and their petty officers. (j) On occasions when firearms have been used against unlawful assemblies it should be the duty of the Magistrate, if one is present, to make adequate arrangements for the care of the wounded persons and for their removal to hospital and also for the disposal of the dead, if any. He should also, then and there, draw up a full report in consultation with the senior police officer present, stating all the circumstances and noting the number of rounds of ammunition issued and expended. If no Magistrate is present, this report shall be prepared by the senior police officer who shall also take all possible action with regard to wounded and dead. (2) The following instructions govern the action of the police when the use of military force becomes necessary:(a) A police officer, of whatever rank, has no authority to require any officer, commissioned or non-commissioned, in command of a military detachment to use force in dispersing a crowd. Any Magistrate may make such a requisition (Section 130, Criminal Procedure Code) and, in emergencies when no Magistrate can be communicated with, a commissioned officer of the regular army may himself order military force to be used. When no Magistrate is available and Discipline and Conduct 431 troops are present, and their intervention is, in the opinion of the senior police officer present, necessary, that officer shall inform the senior commissioned regular army officer present of the situation, requesting his assistance in support of the police if necessary. The military officer receiving such report will decide whether to act on it. (b) When military force has been set in motion for the dispersal of a crowd, any police force previously employed in contact with such crowd shall be withdrawn to prevent confusion. The senior police officer present and the officer commanding the troops shall confer as to the method and exact time of such withdrawal, and as to the subsequent employment of the police; provided that, if the District Magistrate is present, his instructions shall be obtained and acted upon. While no rule can be laid down absolutely, the normal procedure should be for the police to be so withdrawn as to leave a free field of action to the troops, and to be used thereafter (a) in support of the troops for making arrests and pursuing a broken mob, (b) for guarding the flanks and rear of the troops from attack and preventing the outbreak of disturbances in other areas. (c) It must be noted that, when the order to disperse an unlawful assembly by military force has been given, the senior police officer on the spot and all police at the time within the area where military force is being employed come under the orders of the senior military officer present, who is in charge of the operation of dispersal, and remain under his orders to this extent and for the period necessary, but the latter must consult the senior police officer present in any action he thinks it necessary to take. When control of the situation is definitely handed over by the senior civil officer to the military authorities, the police force come fully under military control. (Note. - These instructions are in conformity with the secret instructions on the subject issued by the Government of India, Army Department). (3) Only an officer-in-charge of a police station (and police officers superior in rank of virtue of Section 551, Criminal Procedure Code) can act under Section 127, Criminal Procedure Code. When any other police officer encounters an unlawful assembly, he should immediately send for a Magistrate or a police officer empowered to act under Section 127, Criminal Procedure Code. Should the unlawful assembly commit any overt act of violence before the arrival of such Magistrate or police officer, the senior police officer on the spot, in virtue of other powers conferred by the law, should take such action as is necessary to deal with the situation. Section 149, Criminal Procedure Code, empowers every police officer to interpose for the purpose of preventing, and requires that every police officer shall, to the best of his ability, prevent the commission of any cognizable offence. Section 152, Criminal Procedure Code, empowers a police officer of his own authority to interpose to prevent any injury attempted to be committed in his view to any public property. In addition, all police officers have the same right of private defence which is granted to every person. Every police officer should be fully acquainted with this right which is laid down in Sections 96 to 106, Indian Penal Code. Section 97, Indian Penal Code, makes it clear that every person, and therefore, every police officer, has a right to defend the body of any person, as well as his own body, against any offence affecting the human body and the property of any other person as well as of himself, against any act which is an offence falling under the definition of theft, robbery, mischief or criminal trespass, or which is an attempt to commit theft, robbery, mischief, or criminal trespass. The extent to which the right of private defence may be exercised is laid down in Sections 99, 100, 101 and 103, and the period during which the right exists is explained in Sections 102 and 105.

When the allegations are such as can form the basis of a criminal charge, the Superintendent shall decide at this stage, whether the accused shall be tried departmentally first and judicially thereafter. (iii) If the accused police officer does not admit the misconduct, the officer conduct462 Punjab Police Rules, 1934 Volume 2, CHAPTER 16 ing the enquiry shall proceed to record such evidence, oral and documentary, in proof of the accusation, as is available and necessary to support the charge. Whenever possible, witnesses shall be examined direct, and in the presence of the accused, who shall be given opportunity to take notes of their statements and cross-examine them.

This statement shall also be read out to the accused officer and he shall be given an opportunity to take notes. The accused shall be bound to answer any questions which the enquiring officer may see fit to put to him with a view to elucidating the facts referred to in statements or documents brought on the record as herein provided. (iv) When the evidence in support of the allegations has been recorded the enquiring officer shall, (a) if he considers that such allegations are not substantiated, either discharge the accused himself, if he is empowered to punish him, or recommend his discharge to the Superintendent, or other officer, who may be so empowered, or (b) proceed to frame a formal charge or charges in writing, explain them to the accused officer and call upon him to answer them. (v) The accused officer shall be required to state the defence witnesses whom he wishes to call and may be given time, in no case exceeding forty-eight hours, to prepare a list of such witnesses, together with a summary of the facts as to which they will testify. The enquiring officer shall be empowered to refuse to hear any witnesses whose evidence he considers will be irrelevant or unnecessary in regard to the specific charge framed. He shall record the statements of those defence witnesses whom he decides to admit in the presence of the accused, who shall be allowed to address questions to them, the answers to which shall be recorded; provided that the enquiring officer may cause to be recorded by any other police officer superior in rank to the accused the statement of any such witness whose presence cannot be secured without undue delay or inconvenience, and may bring such statement on to the record. The accused may file documentary evidence and may for this purpose be allowed access to such files and papers, except such as form part of the record of the confidential office of the Superintendent of Police, as the enquiring officer deems fit. The supply of copies of documents to the accused shall be subject to the ordinary rules regarding copying fees. (vi) At the conclusion of the defence evidence or, if the enquiring officer so directs, at any earlier stage following the framing of a charge, the accused shall be required to state his own answer to the charge. He may be permitted to file a written statement and may be given time, not exceeding one week, for its preparation, but shall be bound to make an oral statement in answer to all questions which the enquiring officer may see fit to put to him, arising out of the charge, the recorded evidence, or his own written statement.

Whenever the officer passing the orders of punishment proposes to take into consideration the adverse entries on the previous record of the accused police officer, he shall provide reasonable opportunity to the defaulter to defend himself; and a copy or at least a gist of those entries shall be conveyed to the defaulter and he shall be asked to give such explanation as he may deem fit.

They require only that standard of proof which is necessary to satisfy themselves whether the charge is established or not. Discipline must also be maintained in relation to the proceedings of departmental enquiries. Refusal by an accused police officer to plead or answer questions; inordinate delay in producing his defence; insubordinate behaviour before the enquiring officer, and the intemperate or impertinent questioning of officers by accused officers who are their inferiors in official status, are, in addition to being contrary to the spirit of the rules for the conduct of departmental enquiries, entirely contrary to the requirements of discipline, and shall be treated accordingly. (2) Charges need not be framed in relation only to a specific incident or act of misconduct. When reports received against an officer or a preliminary enquiry show that his general behaviour has been such as to be unfitting to his position, or that he has failed to reach or maintain a reasonable standard of efficiency he may and should be charged accordingly, and a finding of guilty on such a charge will be valid ground for the infliction of any authorised departmental punishment which may be considered suitable in the circumstances of the case.

He is, however, required to report details of the case to the District Magistrate, who will forward a copy of this report to the Superintendent of Police. The District Magistrate himself will similarly send a report to the Superintendent of Police in cases of which he himself takes cognizance. (4) The Local Government has prescribed the following supplementary procedure to be adopted in the case of complaints against police officers in those districts where abuses of the law with the object of victimising such officers or hampering investigation is rife. The District Magistrate will order that all petitions against police officers shall be presented to him personally. If he considers that these petitions are of a frivolous or factious nature, it is within his discretion to take no action on them. When he considers an enquiry to be necessary he will use his discretion whether to send the papers to the Superintendent of Police or to a Magistrate for judicial enquiry. In the case of formal criminal complaints, the District Magistrate will arrange for all cases to be transferred from other courts to his own. (5) Orders have been issued by the Hon’ble Judges of the High Court making it obligatory on all civil and criminal courts, whenever they make strictures on the personal character or professional conduct of a police officer, to send a copy of the judgment to the executive authorities. In the case of the High Court itself the copies will be forwarded to the Local Government. In the case of all other courts (including Courts of Sessions), the copies will be sent by the Judges and Magistrates concerned to the District Magistrate. (6) In cases in which strictures are passed on the conduct of the police by a Sessions Court or by a Magistrate’s Court and no specific recommendation is made by the Court making such strictures that an enquiry should be made, the District Magistrate will decide whether an investigation into the matter is necessary, and if so, whether it shall be conducted by a police officer or by a selected 1[Executive Magistrate]. If he decides that an investigation shall be made, the procedure subsequent to such investigation shall be that laid down in sub-rule (2) above. In cases in which the court passing strictures on the conduct of the police suggests that an enquiry should be made, the District Magistrate will comply with such request in accordance with the procedure prescribed in paragraphs (1) and (2) above. When strictures on the conduct of the police are made by the High Court and communicated to the Local Government direct in accordance with paragraph (5) above, the instructions of Government as to the action to be taken by the local authorities will be communicated to them through the ordinary channels. In cases in which the High Court suggests that an enquiry should be made the Local Government will give orders accordingly. (7) Rules 24.14 and 24.15 provide for reports of all serious charges against the police being communicated to the Local Government by a special report. In cases where such serious charges arise from strictures passed by criminal courts, the Superintendent of Police and the District Magistrate should communicate, either in the report itself or in a covering letter, the procedure which they propose to adopt and any information or notes in connection with the case which they consider should be brought to the notice of Government. Rule 24.15 provides the opportunity for Deputy Inspectors- General and Commissioners similarly to communicate their comments to the local Government. Rule 16.39",

        "title": "Principles of the Criminal Law and Police Organization",
        "body": "The Criminal law of India and the Police organization, which is based upon it, are both founded on the principle that public order depends essentially upon the responsibility of every member of the community within the law to prevent offences and to arrest offenders. The magisterial and police organization is set up to enforce, control and assist this general responsibility. This fundamental principle must be thoroughly understood and borne constantly in mind by police officers of all ranks, but more especially by gazetted officers and upper subordinates. Instructions as to the general relations between police officers and Magistrates are contained in Chapter I of these Rules and some further detailed instructions are placed in this chapter. The ideal to be aimed at in respect of relations with the public is that every police officer, of whatever rank, should be regarded by every law-abiding person as a wise and impartial friend and a protector against injury to his person and property. In proportion as this ideal is approached, the police will receive the information and assistance which they need, in order to combat crime successfully. When confidence and co-operation are lacking, private persons and village officials resort to connivance at crime and to seeking redress for their own losses through treaty with criminals; the police are isolated in their efforts to prevent and detect offences, and can hope for but a small measure of success. The proper relations between the police and the public in a district depend primarily upon the personal attitude of the Superintendent, and the example set by him and enforced upon his subordinates. The most important duties of a Superintendent are to know the people of his district and to know what his subordinates are doing. Such knowledge can only be gained by the fullest personal accessibility, activity in touring, thorough and intelligent supervision and a sympathetic interest in the life of the district and the facts and difficulties of the work of his own men. He must inspire confidence in his subordinates, as well as in the public. While alert to check tyranny, dishonesty and other abuses by his subordinates, he must be as accessible to them as to non-officials, and ready at all times to help them in their difficulties and support them against the evil influences, which they have to face. This should be the attitude of all supervising officers. They should ensure direct access to themselves unimpeded by their subordinates, and must be ready to give a patient hearing to all complaints and grievances, but must avoid creating any impression of spying which would destroy the confidence and undermine the authority of their officers.

While these village officials have many duties besides those connected with the suppression of crime, capacity to assist the criminal administration is one of the factors considered in making appointments, and failure in this duty is a ground for removal from office or forfeiture of emoluments. In the case of headmen, definite duties in respect of reporting and preventing offences are prescribed by the Criminal Procedure Code, and the Land Revenue Rules (see Land Revenue Rules 16 and 20) require them to attend the summons of all officers having jurisdiction in the estate in which they are appointed; to assist all Government officials in the execution of their public duties; to supply information; to assist, if so ordered by the Collector, in the provision on payment of supplies or transport to Government officers on duty, and generally to represent the people of their estates in their relations with Government. Zaildars and inamdars are required by the Land Revenue Rules to report to the police heinous crime and the presence in the zail of bad characters; to assist in prevention, investigations and arrests; see to that headmen perform their duties properly; to notify all orders of Government in their zails and to obey all such orders as require their personal obedience to exert their influence to secure within their zails prompt obedience to all orders of Government; to abstain from interference in litigation, except under orders of Government; to assist all Government officers in the execution of their duties, to supply them with information and to attend them when they visit their zails. (2) It is the duty of gazetted police officers and inspectors to take particular note of the work of zaildars, inamdars and headmen. These officials should be encouraged in the performance of their duties and suitably rewarded when they do well; serious or persistent neglect of duty should be brought to the notice of the Superintendent, and by him to that of the District Magistrate. In the periodical inspections of police stations mention shall always be made of the degree of assistance received by the police from the zaildars and other village officials of the jurisdiction, and of particularly meritorious work or noteworthy dereliction of duty on the part of individuals. (3) Gazetted officers should, from time to time, record remarks in the books kept for the purpose by zaildars and inamdars regarding the extent to which such officials fulfil the purpose of their appointment in so far as the police are concerned. Notes may also appropriately be made by gazetted officers in the police station minute book (Register No. 13) and in Part IV of Village Crime Books regarding particular zaildars, inamdars and headmen. (4) The village watchman, or chaukidar, is a village servant whose chief duty is the watch and ward of the village. He is required to carry reports for the headman, to assist him in tracing offenders and to make arrests as authorized by law. He is responsible to the District Magistrate for the due performance of his duties. Chaukidars are also the agency for the reporting of births and deaths occurring in the rural tracts. For the purpose of recording vital statistics they attend at the police station within the jurisdiction of which their villages are situated at certain appointed times, and Preventive and Detective Organization 555 these occasions are made use of to disseminate items of news and orders connected with the preventive and detective duties of the village officers. The rules regarding the appointment, dismissal, powers, duties and responsibilities of watchmen are framed by Government under Section 39-A of the Punjab Laws Act of 1872. Rule 21.4 21.4 Duties of Police under local and special laws. - Many of the most important and most frequently exercised functions of the police derive from local and special laws. In some case powers so derived have been specially referred to in different chapters of these rules, but, irrespective of such references, a knowledge of the provisions of all local and special laws, more or less comprehensive according to the duties of his rank, is required to every trained police officer. The constitution of the Police Force itself rests on a special law, the Police Act (V of 1861). The administration of the Excise Act, in co-operation with officials of the Excise Department, is one of the most important of the duties of the police. Under this Act, all police officers of and above the rank of head constable are invested with the powers of excise officers Ist class, and all constables with those of excise officers, 3rd class. The control of crime, especially in rural areas, depends largely upon the Punjab Laws Act, the Registration of Habitual Offenders Act and the Criminal Tribes Act. The Arms Act contains cognizable offences of first class importance, and imposes on the police important duties in connection with the inspection of licences. The Cantonment and Municipal Act impose very extensive and varied duties upon police officers serving in areas to which they apply in relation to the enforcement of bye-laws of all sorts. The powers and duties of the police in relation to fires also emanate from the Municipal Act. The same Act, together with the Hackney Carriage Act, Indian Motor Vehicles Act, Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act and certain sections of the Indian Penal Code give to the police all their powers in relation to the control of traffic. The Indian Extradition Act governs the dealings of the police in respect of criminals with Indian States. Many other Acts give powers or impose duties in respect of arrests, custody, search and inspection in relation to particular classes of offence. Rule 21.5",

        "body": "(1) A vital factor in both the detection and prevention of crime is the execution of the law in respect of absconding and harbouring. The provisions of the law are adequate to prevent both these offences but their proper and comprehensive administration demands the constant attention of Magistrates and supervising police officers. The absence or prevalence of absconding and harbouring are among the acid tests of the efficiency of the criminal administration. Instructions as to the taking out and execution of warrants when persons, whose arrest is required, are not immediately found, are contained in rule 26.5. This is the first essential. Under Section 87, Code of Criminal Procedure, any Court may at any time issue a proclamation against a person for whose arrest that court has issued a warrant. All that is necessary is that the court should be satisfied, not necessarily by evidence, that the said person ‘‘has absconded or is concealing himself so that such warrant cannot be executed’’. The court may further at any time after proclamation ‘‘order the attachment of any property, moveable or immovable, or both, belonging to the proclaimed person’’. The period of thirty days mentioned in Section 87, Code of Criminal Procedure, is that within which the absconder is called upon to surrender, it imposes no delay on the issue of attachment orders. The issue of a proclamation under Section 87, Code of Criminal Procedure, renders liable to the penalties of Section 216, Indian Penal Code, any one who gives to the person proclaimed any assistance of the nature described in Section 52-A, Indian Penal Code. (2) The action prescribed in rule 26.5 for obtaining a warrant of arrest shall be taken by the police immediately they have grounds for making such arrest. Every reasonable efforts to execute such warrant shall then be taken. If such efforts fail, the court which 556 Punjab Police Rules, 1934 Volume 3, issued the warrant must be satisfied that the warrant cannot be executed; evidence of the guilt of the wanted man in the offence under investigation is not required. When a proclamation order has been obtained, the police are bound to publish that order as required by Section 87(2), Code of Criminal Procedure. Immediately this has been done the requirements of Section 87(3), Code of Criminal Procedure, shall be complied with. Thereupon, the person wanted becomes a ‘‘proclaimed offender’’ and the rules in Chapter XXIII regarding the entry of such person’s name in the surveillance register, list of proclaimed offenders, notices to village headmen and watchmen of all places where he has connections or which he is likely to visit etcetera shall be forthwith complied with. (3) The procedure of search under warrant and proclamation shall be carried out in every case in which a wanted person cannot be immediately arrested without warrant by the investigating officer. Discretion may be exercised by both the police and magistrates whether to proceed with attachment of property under Section 88, Code of Civil Procedure. In every case, where there is danger of more crime resulting from an absconder remaining at large an attachment order shall be immediately applied for. The police are not authorized to carry out attachment, but it is the duty of the prosecuting branch to see that the necessary orders issued from the court without any delay, and of the officer conducting the investigation to take steps to prevent the improper alienation of attachable property by fictitious mortgage or sale. For this purpose lists of such property should be made, as part of the investigation, and attached to the police file of the case, and the village headman concerned should be directed to report any attempt at alienation or removal pending the issue of attachment orders. The lists of property prepared by the investigating officer, attested by competent witnesses, should be put into court with the application for an attachment order. (4) To prevent harbouring, without which no absconder can remain at large, thorough publicity in regard to the issue of a warrant and subsequent proclamation order is essential. If this receives proper attention, the defence of ignorance is denied to the person who can be proved to have rendered any sort of assistance to an absconder. Rule 21.6",

All other cases must be decided on their merits and no hard-and- fast rule can be laid down. It will be necessary to show that the change of residence is of a permanent or quasipermanent nature. Mere absence from home for day or two does not constitute a change of residence is of a permanent or quasi-permanent nature. Mere absence from home for day or two does not constitute a change of residence. Prevention of Offences 659 2. In cases in which at the time of notifying ‘‘change of residence’’, the released convict reports his intention to return to the existing residence already notified under Rule II, III or IV within a period of one month such change shall be called ‘‘temporary change of residence’’. 3. When the Superintendent of Police receives an intimation from the officer-incharge of the jail of an intended place of residence notified to the latter under Rule II, he shall at once forward a copy thereof to the officer-in-charge of the police station within the jurisdiction of which such place is situated. This officer will, immediately upon the arrival of the released convict, report the date thereof to the Superintendent of Police. 4. When a released convict notifies a change of residence or a temporary change or residence to the officer-in-charge of the police station, the particulars required by Rule VII shall be entered in Form 23.39(2). The officer-in-charge of the police station will deliver a copy thereof to the released convict and will forward the original to the officer- in-charge of the police station within the jurisdiction of which the released convict has intimated his intention to reside. The latter officer, on arrival of the released convict, will fill up column 6, and, in the case of the residence being of a permanent character, will at once return the form to the police station from which he received it. It case the residence is to be of a temporary character, he will retain the form until the convict reports his departure, when column 7 will be filled up and the form returned to the police station of issue. 5. On arrival at the police station within the jurisdiction of which his new residence is situated, the released convict will produce his copy of the form and get the date of his arrival entered in column 6. In the case of a permanent change of residence his copy will be returned to him at once. In the case of temporary change of residence, it will be kept until the date of departure is verbally reported. Column 7 will then be filled up, and the copy will be returned to the released convict to make over to the officer from whom he originally received it. 6. The names of such released convicts will be entered in the surveillance register (Police Station Register No. X). 660 Punjab Police Rules, 1934 Volume 3, CHAPTER 23 force at the cost of considerable special expenditure and special organisation on the part of Government, and of wholesale interfere with the normal movements of the seasonal migration. A study of the subject shows that registration would not lead to the desired results and is not necessary. III. The composition of the immigration. - The main division of Pathans who habitually visit India may be briefly described as follows:A. Afghan subjects and residents of Independent Tribal Territory. 1. Northern Ghilzais, Ningraharis, & c.,who enter India via Khyber Pass and Kurram Valley. These are mainly camel drivers or labourers, and the vast majority of them give no trouble. Occasionally a gang of bad characters from this class is formed, and, the crimes committed by such a gang are often of a particularly violent nature. 2. The Southern Ghilzais or ‘‘Powindahs’’, who enter India mainly by the Tochi and Gumal Valleys. These tribes usually leave their families in the Derajat, while the men disperse over the length and breadth of India, trading in cloth or other goods and, with their camels, acting as carriers on the large scale. From the point of view of general public security in the Punjab, this very large class may be classified as non-criminal. They dabble in the arms and forged note traffic and are said occasionally to be addicted to misappropriation of goods entrusted to them as hired carriers. On rare occasions parties which have made their permanent winter encampments in the Mianwali district instead of in the Derajat, may be concerned in a dacoity. the control of such parties, however, is a purely local problem, which the lines stereotyped by long unaged in the neighbouring trans-indus districts. 3. Tribal contingents from Khost and other parts of the Afghan Province of ‘‘Simat-iJanubi’’. On the basis of information at present available this division of immigrants appear to be one of the main causes of concerned from the point of view of crime. It includes various tribes, but the Jadrans (or Zadras) come in the greatest numbers to the Punjab. These tribes have in the past given but nebulous allegiance to Kabul and have been a perpetual source of trouble both to their own Government against which they were in open rebellion in 1924 - and to the Frontier Province Administration. They are, for the most part exceedingly poor and, compared with most Pathans, degenerate, but hardy. those who come to the Punjab in the winter scatter all over the Province, but chiefly in the North-Western Districts, in small parties, often with their families, and include a high proportion of criminals. The nature of their activities and proposals for their control will be discussed later. 4. Immigrants from among the Baluchistan Tribes. - There is record of occasional crime by this class, and their habits and composition require study. 5. Immigrants from North-West Frontier Province Tribal Territory. - This class is distinct from the various categories of Afghan subjects, in that their influx into India is in no sense tribal. Adult males from almost all the trans-border tribes come to or through the Punjab in numbers which vary according to the characteristics of the various tribes and to locally prevailing conditions, but they all come in their individual capacity in search of a temporary livelihood. In the Punjab this class usually finds its way to the scene of work on big contracts. The class includes many habitual criminals, whose control demands special measures. B. British subjects from the Districts of the North-West Frontier Province. This second main division should, for purposes of applying suitable control be subdivided into various categories, but it will suffice here to consider it as one, especially as the greater number of immigrants belonging to it come from the Northern districts of Hazara and Peshawar. The main feature of this class is that it includes a large number or habitual offenders of Prevention of Offences 661 two kinds; (a) men who desire to escape the attention of the Police at their homes, (b) men who, to ensure immunity in a deliberately criminal career in the Punjab and other Provinces, are scrupulously careful of their reputation at their homes. There is one more category of Pathans which must not be overlooked in considering this subject. In many of the large towns of the Punjab there is a considerable number of Pathans permanently settled. Their status varies from that of substantial contractors to tea-shopkeepers or tonga drivers. Their importance lies in their position as ‘‘contracts’’ between wandering Pathans and local people or local knowledge. IV. The nature of crime attributed to Pathans. - The classes of crime committed by Pathans may be summarised as follows:(1) Raids by gangs formed in independent territory and descending to commit a specific offence, retiring thereafter back to independent territory. On the grounds of the history of such cases it is an absolutely fair statement to say that, if there are no Punjabi outlaws in tribal territory, there will be no raids of this nature. Between 1915 and 1923, Mahsud gangs harried in the Isa Khel tahsil, led by Kulu, an Isa Khel outlaw. The Attock district has suffered when its own outlaws have been living with Kohat Pass Afridis and have led gangs from there. Attock and Rawalpindi suffered inthe years before the War, when Sultan, a Rawalpindi outlaw, was in the Black mountain and when Fazlo and his gang were with the Gaduns. The recent Hassanabdal raid is a partial exception, but the local ‘‘razdari’’ without which no raid is ever committed was provided in that case by the employment of a Pathan (in fact an Afghan Shinwari) as chowkidar - a form of imbecility which might well be prohibited. The prevention of raids in the Frontier Province is mainly a matter of sustained activity against outlaws. In the less complicated conditions in this respect in the Punjab, similar action should provide an absolute preventive. (2) Dacoities by gangs of Pathans residing temporarily in the Punjab. This is one of the two classes of crime by Pathans, which most requires special measures of prevention. The first stage in evolving such measures is to ascertain the circumstances in which and by whom this class of crime is committed and so to concentrate preventive action where it can be effective. (3) House breaking, animal theft and cognate offences committed by Pathans. Crime of this type is usually due to large concentration of Pathan labour or to the formation of a particular gang of expert criminals. (4) Specialised crime carried on by Pathans alone or by Pathans and Punjabis in combination. This now exists to a serious and dangerous extent, especially in respect of the smuggling of excisable commodities and the traffic in arms, and undoubtedly requires special measures of prevention. V. Organisation. - The foregoing summary shows that the types of crime committed by Pathans and the criminal element among the immigrants are readily defined. Control can be obtained through concentration within these limits rather than by sweeping restrictions. The primary need is to make generally available to the police in districts as much information as possible in regard to this class of crime and to co- ordinate their methods of dealing with it. The organisation to this end should be suited to the requirements of all India and all that is needed is the development of existing machinery. Bombay and Calcutta already have ‘‘Pathan Sections’’ in the Crime Branch of their Criminal Investigation Departments. The Punjab has the embryo of a similar section. The North- Western Frontier Provinces have a section which devotes intensive attention to the arms trade. It has been mentioned that there is a class of criminals, having their homes in the NorthWest Frontier Province Districts,who have clean records at their homes, but make profession of crime in other Provinces. the record was published a few years ago of one 662 Punjab Police Rules, 1934 Volume 3, CHAPTER 23 such individual against whom nothing was known at his home, though, when finally arrested in the Central Provinces, some thirty serious crimes with violence were traced against him; special attention is needed to ensure that, by the proper use of History Sheets, Bad Character Rolls and Intimation Sheets, such cases are brought under strict surveillance at their homes, and are treated precisely as if they were locally troublesome. The not unnatural tendency, in the absence of special supervision is for the local police to turn the blind eye to such cases. So far as residents of the administered districts of the Frontier Province are concerned effective control of wandering criminals is quite practicable, provided the normal police machinery for the interchange of information is efficiently worked and followed by action in the ‘‘home’’ Police Station under the security sections of the Criminal Procedure Code, and for restriction of movement under the Habitual Offenders Act (which is in force in the North-West Frontier Province) or under section 36 of the Frontier Crimes Regulation. The control of these British subjects covers quite half the danger field. Where Afghan subjects and independent tribesmen are concerned direct control is not easy, and wholesale scrutiny is almost impracticable in view of the fact that the migration in the autumn and spring is compressed into a few weeks, during which, literally, a torrent of humanity flows through the Passes. Friendly contact can be made with the Maliks and leading men of the vast majority of well behaved immigrants, and,through them, as much valuable information and assistance in controlling lawless elements can be obtained. The Pathan is peculiarly amenable to friendly co-operation of this nature, and nothing is likely to be so effective in isolating the criminals from the well behaved and bringing them under effective control, as the provision of a sufficiency of officers in the Punjab, who understand enough about Pathans to gain some measure of the confidence of the well conducted, and to inspire some wholesome dread in the ill-disposed. It appears essential that the Punjab Criminal Investigation Department should have a Pathan section consisting of at least 1 inspector, 1 sub- inspector and 4 or 5 head constables, obtained on deputation from the Frontier Province with perhaps an element from Baluchistan. Although the Pathan immigration is a matter of the winter months only, it will be shown that the staff suggested could be most usefully and fully employed throughout the year. This section of the Punjab Criminal Investigation Department (and similar sections in other Provinces which suffer from pathan criminality should work in the completest co-operation with the Peshawar Criminal Investigation Department, by exchanging information, by seeing that information is both made available to and used by districts, and in devising and operating methods to meet different varieties of crime. It is noticeable at present, both that ridiculously little information is generally available on the subject of Pathan crime, and that what little has been made available is not acted upon. The Criminal Intelligence Gazette should be much more freely used both or the publication of particulars of individual suspects, for general information regarding the habits and modus operandi of different gangs or classes of Pathans and for instruction in regard to methods of prevention and detection. The Pathan experts in the Criminal Investigation Department should also be used, especially during the winter, in touring areas where Pathans are settled either in villages or on big contracts, with the object of bringing the local police into touch with the settlers, marking down and initiating action in respect of bad characters among them, and assisting in the investigation of cases in which Pathans are suspected to have been concerned. To supplement this small body of experts it is suggested that selected sub- inspectors of the Punjab Police might be sent in batches of 5 or 5 every year for a period of 3 months attachments to the North-West Frontier Province. In this period they should cover as many of the Frontier Districts as possible with the object of acquiring an elementary acquaintance with the many different types of Pathans, and with their country and language. Such selections would naturally be made chiefly from the North-Western Districts of the Province, as these are most closely concerned. It would be advantageous that these Punjab officers should be attached definitely to an experienced inspector in Prevention of Offences 663 each Frontier District which they visit, so that one individual may be responsible for giving them the most comprehensive instruction and hints. In some instances in the past, districts such as Sargodha have obtained the loan for one or more Pathan Non-commissioned Officers direct from one of the Frontier Province District; this is a useful supplement to other measures suggested. the object of the deputation to Frontier Districts is to meet to some extent the present practical difficulty in Pathan cases. There is often no single police official in a district who knows enough about Pathans to make even the simplest inquires from them or to distinguish between a Powndah and Peshawari. With the machinery improved on the lines suggested it would become possible systematically to tackle the various classes of crime and professional criminals which have been described. VI. Preventive measures. - Dacoities other than raids, are committed by two main classes of Pathans, the poverty-striken labourers from Khost, who have been already described, and bad characters mainly from the Peshawar or Hazara Districts. All such cases should be regarded as requiring Criminal Investigation Department assistance in their investigation, in order that all the resources of ‘‘Intelligence’’ on the subject may be brought to bear and that gang ramifications may be thoroughly sifted with a view not only to convictions in isolated cases, but comprehensive preventive action. Investigations now proceedings the Western Range afford instances both of the benefit of Coordinated and the defects of isolated action. From the pooling investigations in several districts it is now clear - and there are good ground for hope that the case can be proved - that for years past dacoities of a particular types have been committed, to the number of about a dozen annually, by the ‘‘badmash’’ element of one or two small sections of the Jadran tribe from Khost. The culprits probably amount to not more than 60 or 70 in all, from which total, gangs 5 to 20 in number have been habitually formed for committing specific dacoities at places previously spied out by individual members of the faternity. More than 40 arrests have been made of persons suspected to belong to this criminal group, but, before co-operation could be fully set going, several of these suspects had been released by individual districts, because in their own particular cases, evidence for prosecution was lacking. The investigation is now being controlled by the Criminal investigation Department, and special assistance has been obtained from peshawar. It is premature to recommended any particular action, but apart from the possibilities of individual or gang prosecutions, it seems probably that it will be possible to put forward a strong case for excluding the particular Afghan-tribes concerned from India for a term of years, or for registering it as a ‘‘Criminal Tribe’’ in the Punjab. This investigation affords a clear indication of the process by which special staff of export should be able, by investigations into the habits of all classes of Pathan immigrants, to eliminate the well behaved and concentrate on the genuine criminals. the action to be taken where dacoities are being committed by Pathans of British territory is, as had already been indicated, merely the thorough application of normal police procedure. The use of the provisions of section 109, Criminal Procedure Code and of the Foreigners Act have repeatedly been advocated for controlling suspected Pathans. The former is not a very valuable weapon when almost every Pathan around in the Punjab is able and willing to earn his living by honest labour and can always produce evidence to that effect. The use of the Foreigners Act is confined to Afghan subjects and independent tribesmen and their deportation to the Frontier is of no avail if they return immediately to another part of the Punjab, where the chances of their suffering the penalty of violation of the expulsion order are negligible. Where the Foreigners Act is used to seems advisable that photographs, finger prints and descriptive rolls of the deportee should be widely circulated. There appears to be no legal method of deporting from the Punjab, merely on suspicion, a resident of one of the administered districts of the Frontier Province, but, whenever a conviction,even under section 109, Criminal Procedure Code, or in a trivial offence, has been obtained against such an individual, it is possible to get him back to his home by classifying him for transfer to his home jail for release (i.e. P.R.T.). The Regu664 Punjab Police Rules, 1934 Volume 3, CHAPTER 23 lations might will be amended, if necessary, to permit of this being done. Police co-operation would ensure that a habitual criminal so transferred would be restricted on release from jail. The next category requiring attention is the gang labour under contractors. This branch of the subject requires detailed study by the expert staff. It appears that these labour gangs are on the whole well behaved - though if memory serves, Pathan labour gave considerable trouble when the Upper Jhelum Canal was being dug. Lately they have come chiefly to notice in connection with fairly petty thefts of cattle,contractor’s donkeys and so on. there is no doubt, however, that dangerous criminals are likely to be found among such gatherings. - both men who will commit skilled or violence crime and men who desire to disappear from a serious hue and cry elsewhere. Labour contractors - often themselves Pathans - or ‘Jemadars’ should be made to assist the police in shifting the antecedents of their men, reporting suspicious absences, etc. Police activity of this sort requires to be conducted with considerations for the requirements of the Public Works Department or other authority responsible for the work; it would be as well for general instructions, which would meet police requirements in the matter, to be worked out inc consultation with the Public Works Department. Sepcialised crime, in which pathans are prominently concerned, consists mainly of traffic in arms and in Afghan opium and similar excisable commodities. Each such branch of crime obviously requires special attention,for bestowing which the suggested Pathan section of the Criminal Investigation Department is the most suitable agency. It is impossible to discuss the details of this class of crime within the scope of this note, but two special features of it may be noted. It exists because there is the Frontier a source of supply to meet a Punjab demand,and there is a close association which does not exist in other classes of ‘Pathan crime’ between Punjabis and Pathans to the extent that Punjabi frequently visit the Frontier Province to make their illicit purchases. It is clear, therefore, that while the co-operation of the Frontier Province Administration in controlling such enterpots of illicit raid as the village of Jam in the Khyber Agency is called for, it is equally necessary in the Punjab at attack the local traders in and purchasers of the goods obtainable from these sources. A further point worth recording is that the extension of this class of smuggling is natural consequences of the permanent location of Punjabi troops in a large number of outposts and Cantonments beyond the Administrative Frontier. Before 1915 all these areas were garrisoned solely by local irregular corps. troops were all in Cantonments in British territory where any illicit traffic between Punjabi soldiers and local residents was bound to come to the notice of the district police before it developed to any serious extent. Now-a-days there is absolutely no effective check on the doings of the thousands of Punjabis cantoned in Wazirisan and the Khyber. They are in continuous contract with local residents, who have access to camps and cantonments on a hundred legitimate excuses; it is little more difficult for the sepoy to buy a revolver or a seer of opium than it is for him to buy a seer of milk. The police are helpless; they cannot except on the strongest of grounds and with the permission of the military authorities, search sepoys going on leave through Bannu, Dera Ismail Khan, or Peshawar. An important aid to the control of Pathan criminals generally is that the police (both the special staff and the district police) should acquire as full a knowledge as possible of Pathans who carry on permanent occupations in the Punjab and should cultivate such relations, as will ensure access to all information of importance, with such local residents as have special contract with Pathans. In many Punjab towns there are a considerable number of Pathans settled both in respectable commercial positions and as tonga drivers, tea-shopkeepers and so on; there are also numerous traders, both Hindu and Muhammadans who have a regular Pathan clientele. It is not the houses or shops of the more respectable of such persons that Pathans seeking work or passing through a town habitually resort for help, for news of their friends and for lodging. Respectable people of this sort, and keepers of tea-shops or lodging houses are frequently used as accommodation Prevention of Offences 665 addresses for correspondence between Pathans including those who are criminally associated. While friendly relations with the better class resident Pathan, and other ‘contracts’ such as those mentioned, would open up many sources of valuable informations, the less respectable resident Pathan community requires more direct supervision, both regard personal character and associates and visitors. Some of these residence Pathan doubtless commit crime themselves, but it is maintainly in connection with the disposal of property stolen by ‘‘immigrants’ and harbouring the latter before the and after commission of offences, that they are important. Though the foregoing review shows that the criminal activities of Pathans in the Punjab are not amenable to control by such a method, it is worthwhile to consider briefly the available experience of wholesale- registration. Afghan Passport Regulations have been in existence for some years, including a special from of passport for nomads and drivers of wheeled or animal transport only. Theoretically, every emigrant from Afghanistan who comes within these categories is bound to provide himself annually with such a passport, which should contain his full description and other particulars and a record of the dependents accompanying him. the fee is Rs. 2 and the passport includes the usual request to the officials of friendly Governments to afford the bearer assistance and protection. A considerable proportion of Afghan subjects entering India now-a-days possess these passport. Such persons, when asked, never mention the sum of Rs. 2 as the fee; it is always from Rs. 3 to Rs. 5. The passports are signed by petty ‘Moharrirs’ they are but little guarantee of identity and none whatever of character. The revenue which they bring in may be of some value to the Afghan Government and to its servants. this aspect of the matter is the only incentive to force them upon as many travellers as possible, but whole classes, which do not pass the headquarters of a ‘Hakim’ on their way to India, never receive a passport. On the other hand evidence is already appearing of a tendency on the part of subordinate police, village headmen and even magistrates to regard these Afghan passports as guarantees at lest of bona fides, if not of good character. when the criminal elements among the immigrants wakes up to this state of affairs, they will take good care to provide themselves with insurance policies against molestation, even though the issuing Moharrir may raise the premium immoderately. Instructions might well be issued that these Afghan passports are of no value whatever as a guide to the character of the holder and confer absolutely no immunity. In point of fact the issue of a passport is in itself of no value without the visa of the country to be traversed. No British Indian visa is granted on the Afghan ‘Nomads passport’ and it is understood that the Government of India have definitely decided to exclude nomads entirely from any system of passport control which may be enforced on the Indian side of the Afghan border.

The distinction between the form of reports required by the above-mentioned two sections has been defined as follows by the Punjab Chief Court (now High Court):Every information covered by section 154, Criminal Procedure Code, must be reduced to writing as provided in that section and the substance thereof must be entered in the police station daily diary, which is the book provided for the purpose. It is only information which raises a reasonable suspicion of the commission of a cognizable offence within the jurisdiction of the police officer to whom it is given, which compels action under Section 157, Criminal Procedure Code. (2) With the exception of cases mentioned in rule 24.10 below, in every case in which the officer in charge of a police station, from information or otherwise, has reason to suspect the commission of an offence, which he is empowered under section 156, Criminal Procedure Code, to investigate, he shall enter in full such information or other intelligence as soon as practicable in the First Information Report Register, shall have each copy signed, marked or sealed by the information, if present, shall seal each with the station seal, and shall dispose of the copies in accordance with rule 24.5, and if he abstains from investigation under either of the provisos to section 157 of the Code he shall submit the copy intended for the magistrate through the Superintendent. At the same time a reference to such report shall be entered in the Station Diary, register No. II. (3) All such entries shall, if possible, be made by the officer in charge himself, and, if not so possible, by the station clerk under his direction. Short lists of property stated to have been transferred by the offence may be entered in the report, as also details of any property recovered without search under section 103, Criminal procedure Code, but detailed lists of property so transferred or recovered on search shall be entered in the first case diary submitted in the case. (4) When it is necessary to question a person bringing information of the commission of an offence, special attention shall be paid to the following matters and the results of the inquires shall be clearly recorded in the first information report:(a) The source from which the information was obtained and the circumstances under which the informant ascertained the names of the offenders and witnesses (if any are mentioned). (b) Whether the informant was an eye-witness to the offence. Rule 24.2 24.2 Written reports by village headmen. - (1) With a view to encouraging written reports, village headmen shall be furnished with a supply of printed copies of Form 24.2(1) for written reports of cognizable offences. The substance of the form shall be explained to them, and they shall be instructed to give a form to every person who requires one for use, and if so requested by the complainant to send the form by post ‘‘service unpaid’’ or by the village watchman to the police station after it has been filled up and signed, sealed or attested by the thumb-impression of the complainant and by the signature or seal of the lambardar. Opportunity shall be taken to bring to the notice of the public, verbally and by means of notices affixed to the police station notice boards, the facilities which exist for making reports of offences in writing. It shall be explained that it is not compulsory on any complainant to make a written report, if he prefers to make a verbal one. Information to the Police 679 (2) Whenever a written report of a cognizable offence is received at a police station, it shall be attached to the copy of the First Information Report which is retained in the police station and copies shall be attached to the duplicates, provided that only the check receipt prescribed by the form need be sent to the complainant. The original written report shall be detached from the police station copy of the First Information Report and attached to the charge sheet or final report when the investigation is completed. When a case is sent up on an incomplete charge-sheet the original report shall be similarly attached. (3) A notice in Urdu shall be prominently displayed in every police station in the province, drawing the attention of the public to the fact that the payment of gratuities by the public to police officials for recording complainants is strongly disapproved by Government. The notice shall state as briefly as possible that police officials are the servants of the public and paid by it, and that acceptance of gratuities is strictly forbidden by the rules of the police department and renders defaulters liable to serious penalties. The notice shall conclude with an admonition that demands for such gratuities should be invariably resisted and reported to the Superintendent of Police. Rule 24.3",

        "title": "The duties of the Police as Excise Officers",
        "body": "(1) Co-operation between the excise and police forces is necessary for the detection and investigation of excise offences. The Inspector-General of Police and the Financial-Commissioner lay stress upon this co-operation as one of the principal secrets of successful working. Any case of jealous or obstructive working will be severely dealt with. (2) When an officer in charge of a police station becomes aware of an excise offence, he shall at once register it as a police case and inform the District Excise Officer, who with respect to such cases shall be regarded as the magistrate in charge of the police station. The excise sub-inspector concerned shall also be informed and his co-operation invited, but no delay shall be allowed to occur merely in order to obtain his presence. (3) All excise inspectors and sub-inspectors are required to maintain a First Information Report Register for the registration of complaints and reports of excise offences. In all cognizable cases a copy of the First Information Report shall be sent to the police station in whose jurisdiction the offence is reported. In return the excise inspector or sub-inspector will be given a copy of the Police First Information Report as a report. (4) An excise inspector or sub-inspector shall not ordinarily attempt a search or make an arrest by himself. He shall always obtain the assistance of the police sub-inspector. If, however, delay is likely to defeat the ends of justice, the excise inspector or sub-inspector shall make the arrest or search himself, and at the same time send to the police sub-inspector for assistance. (5) The prevention of illicit distillation of spirit is one of the most important of the duties of the police. This will not be effected by isolated seizures. It involves careful and sustained enquiry and a complete knowledge of his jurisdiction by the officer in charge of the police station. As a rule the manufacture of elicit spirit is confined to certain castes which are habitual consumers of spirit. The most probable localities of illicit traffic should thus be easily ascertainable by the officer incharge of the police station. It is impossible for an elicit still to be regularly worked in a village without the knowledge of the chaukidars and lambardars. The trade betrays itself by the resulting smell, the accumulation of refuse, and the occurrence of drunkenness, where no means of elicit supply exist. If these things happen and the village officials make no report, it is obvious that they are conniving at the offence. In such cases the officer in charge of the police station must at once take steps, to have these rural officials punished. Where it is notorious that illicit stills are worked, the officer in charge of the police station neglects his duty if he does not arrange to put in operation the provisions for search, seizure, and prosecution contained in the Excise Act. (6) If it is found that illicit manufacture of country spirit has been extensively carried on in a police station jurisdiction, and preventive action has not been taken by the police, neglect of duty on the part of the officer in charge of the police station will be presumed. (7) Attention must also be paid to the unlicensed sale of spirit in large towns by sodawater sellers and others, and to the smuggling of country spirit in thanas adjoining Indian States. (8) Any charas coming into the Punjab by any other routes than those sanctioned should at once be detained under section 61 of the Excise Act, and the orders of the Col688 Punjab Police Rules, 1934 Volume 3, CHAPTER 24 lector taken. Charas smugglers generally travel by rail and can easily be captured in cooperation with the railway checking staff, who while examining their tickets can also examine their luggage. (9) The use of cocaine, except for medical and surgical purposes, is altogether prohibited in the Punjab. The principal places in the Punjab into which it is smuggled are Lahore, Amritsar, Rawalpindi, Ambala and Karnal. (10) offences against the opium law vary in their nature with various districts: the most important offences, viz., smuggling and illicit sale of smuggled opium (whether contrived by licensed vendors themselves or by private individuals) being common or uncommon according to the geographical position of districts with reference to Rajputana, Afghanistan and the Hill States, or even railway communication with Nepal. (11) No opium can be imported into a district without a pass; and any police officer can, therefore, detain bulk opium if there is no pass. He can also search a person whom he believes to be guilty of having excess quantities of opium in his possession. Any police officer above the rank of head constable may search premises in which he believes smuggled or illicit opium is stored. The legal limit of possession of opium is two tolas and any person bringing it from any Indian State in excess of this amount is liable to arrest and prosecution under section 9 of the Act. (12) the sale of all preparations of opium for smoking of illegal. There is need of continued activity in tracing out and prosecuting proprietors of chandu and madak dens in which sales occur, the object being to make indulgence in opium smoking so difficult and disreputable that the younger generation will be unlikely to acquire it. Under the Opium Smoking Act, 1923, members of opium smoking assemblies as well as proprietors of houses used for opium smoking are liable to prosecution. Under section 14 of the Act every officer of the police department is required to give reasonable aid to an excise officer making any arrest or search under the Act. The police have no powers of search, seizure or arrest under the Punjab Opium smoking Act; but they have such powers under sections 14 and 15 of the Opium Act, 1978, against any individual in possession of more than the half tola of preparations of admixtures of opium used for smoking which is the limit of legal possession under section 9 of the Act. (13) The Financial Commissioner has impressed upon all Deputy Commissioners the necessity of granting liberal rewards both to informers and to arresting officers in all excise cases. Rewards to sub-inspectors and officers of lower rank may be sanctioned by the Deputy Commissioners up to Rs. 200, but the sanction of the Financial Commissioner is required for larger rewards and for rewards to officers of higher rank. Information to the Police 689 690 Punjab Police Rules, 1934 Volume 3, CHAPTER 24 2. Under Military Regulations, Officers Commanding detachments report the loss or recovery of arms, important components or ammunition to the Superintendent of Police, or, if the loss or recovery takes place in an Indian State or a Union of States, to an appropriate officer of the Government of the State or Union designated in this behalf. The Superintendent of Police or the Officer of the State or Union so designated, as the case may be, is then responsible for all further action for tracing and recovery of the lost or stolen articles. 3. Reports should be made by the Superintendents of Police or the Officers of the States or Unions, as the case may be, to the Provincial Criminal Investigation Department of the loss, theft or recovery of arms, important components and ammunition coming under the following category, of which they may receive information from any source whether military, civil or private (i) Machine Guns, Light automatics, Grenades and articles of Royal Air Force armaments. (ii) Rifles, Revolvers and Pistols, Government or private. (iii) Barrels and bolts of.303 bore. (iv) Ammunition for cannon, machine guns and high velocity rifles. (v) High explosives, whether in bulk or in made-up charges including fuses and detonators. 4. (a) Reports concerning items of the above category should be made by telegram wherever there is prima facie evidence or reasonable suspicion of a recent theft. In other cases reports should be made by letter. In all cases every effort must be made to include either in the initial report or in a very early continuation report the fullest possible details both for the identification of the missing arms, components or ammunition and as regards the methods and identity of the thieves. (b) Provincial Criminal Investigation Departments on receipt of reports according to the above instructions will be responsible for the direction of suitable action for detection and recovery. If in any case there may appear grounds for suspecting the agency of professional arms thieves from the North-West Frontier, Telegraphic information giving the fullest available particulars should be sent to the Deputy Inspector- General of Police, Criminal Investigation Department, East Punjab (telegraphic address ‘CIDEAST, SIMLA’). 5. A return of all identification arms, etc., lost or stolen or recovered should be maintained by the Provisional Criminal Investigation Department and should be sent in annually to the Director, Intelligence Bureau. 6. All reports of losses, thefts and recoveries of arms, etc., should be published by Provincial Criminal Investigation Department in their Criminal Intelligence Gazettes or Confidential Supplements. Such reports must invariably include all details necessary to establish the identity of any particulars weapon, or component part. 7. When losses are sufficiently serious to be brought to the notice of the Government of India, or to rank as matters of public interest, as well as in the following cases:(a) when the theft appears to be the work of Ut Khels or other professional rifle thieves. (b) when the loss appears to indicate that standing rules for the custody of arms and ammunition, either in possession of regiments, or individuals or during transit for rail or otherwise, are defective and should be amended, intimation of such losses should be telegraphed to the Director, Intelligence Bureau, New Delhi, by the Provincial Criminal Investigation Department, and copies of all subsequent reports submitted by the Superintendent of Police should also be sent to him. Information to the Police 691 8. In the particular case of revolvers, rifles, and pistols, all losses, thefts and recoveries of such weapons as bear the manufacturer’s number should be reported to the Director, Intelligence Bureau, by the Provincial Criminal Investigation Departments. The reports regarding recoveries should include information, if possible, as to where, when and form whom the weapon was obtained by the person from whom it is recovered. All reports should be submitted as soon as convenient after the loss, theft or recovery. 9. No report need be made under these rules in the case of the loss or theft of smooth bore weapons, ammunition for such weapons, swords, bayonets, or accutrements. Converted Martini-Hanries and Sniders are classed as smooth bore weapons. 10. Deliberate attempts to smuggle arms and ammunition into India, by land or sea or air, should promptly be reported to the Director, Intelligence Bureau. Similarly the discovery of fire-arm which appear to have been deliberately smuggled into India should also be reported to the same quarter. In all instances, full particulars of the articles seized, such as the maker’s name, place of manufacture, number, bore and other distinguishing marks in the case of fire-arms, and maker’s name, bore and distinguishing marks in the case of cartridge, should be communicated at the time the report is made or as soon afterwards as possible. Information, if available, obtained from the smugglers or otherwise, as to where, when and from whom the weapons, etc., were obtained should also be given. Whenever a prosecution is initiated with respect to a reported case of smuggling or, or attempt to smuggle, arms and ammunition, the result should also be communicated to the Director, Intelligence Bureau. ‘These instructions do not affect the quarterly returns of arms and ammunition seized by the customs, which should continue to be submitted by the Criminal Investigation Departments of maritime provinces and the provinces having air ports in their jurisdictions’. --------------692 Punjab Police Rules, 1934 Volume 3, CHAPTER 24 694 Punjab Police Rules, 1934 Volume 3, CHAPTER 24 696 Punjab Police Rules, 1934 Volume 3, CHAPTER 25 orders of the senior officer and neither shall leave until the question of jurisdiction has been settled and acknowledged.

It is the duty, however, of every officer receiving a report to consider not only the intrinsic importance of the offence alleged and the expressed wishes of the complainant but the bearing which the report has or may have on the detection of other cases or on the prevention of crime and the control of criminals. Very many cases which appears trivial in themselves may, if investigated furnish a clue to the operations of professional criminals or afford valuable material at a later date for preventive action. In practice it is seldom advisable for an officer-in-charge of a police station to avail himself of the power to refuse investigations, which the law gives him. (2) When, at the time when a report of a cognizable offence is received, the investigating staff of the police station concerned is already occupied with more important cases, the investigation of which would suffer by being interrupted, such report shall be duly recorded and investigation may be dispensed with. Such action not be held to limit the discretion of the officer-in-charge of the police station to investigate the case at a later date, if he thinks it desirable to do so. (3) If the informant is present when the first information report is recorded, he shall be informed forthwith that no investigation will be made, and, after noting this fact in the first information report, his signature or thumb-mark shall be taken to it. If the informant is not present, he shall be informed in writing by post card, or by the delivery of a notice by hand, and the fact that this has been done shall be noted in the first information report. (4) When investigation is dispensed with, a note shall be made in the first information Investigation 697 report stating whether the complainant desires an investigation or not and full reasons shall be given for abstaining from investigation. All such cases shall be brought to the notice of the Superintendent of Police personally, who shall pass such orders on them as he may think fit in accordance with the principle embodied in this rule.

When such assistance is required a full report shall be sent to the Assistant Inspector General, Crime and Criminal Tribes, so that he may be in a position to decide whether it is essential to send an expert to the scene of the crime or whether the material to be dealt with should be sent to the expert. In making such reports use should be made of telegraphic and telephonic facilities.

For this reason all officers-in-charge of police stations shall instruct their subordinates as well as all lambardars and chaukidars that, when any crime occurs all footprints and other marks existing on the scene of the crime should be carefully preserved and a watch set to see that as few persons as possible are permitted to visit the scene of the crime. 1[(2) When it desired to produce evidence of the identity of tracks found at the scene of or in connection with a crime, the procedure for securing the record of such evidence shall be similar to that prescribed in Rule 26.32 for the identification of suspects. The attendance of a Magistrate of the highest available status, shall be secured, but if no Magistrate is available and the case is of great urgency, independent and literate witnesses of reliable character like Sarpanches or Panches or Lambardars, shall be requested to conduct proceedings, but before they hold the parade, the rule regarding the holding of parades shall be explained to them. In the presence of the Magistrate or other persons conducting the test and in conforming with any reasonable directions which they may give, ground shall be prepared for the tests. On this ground the suspect or suspects and not less than five other persons, for each suspect, shall be required to walk. The Magistrate or the person conducting the test shall record the names of all these persons and the order in which they 2. Substituted vide Punjab Govt.

The suspect shall, of course, be given option to take any place of his choice in the Parade and a note to this effect shall be recorded in the Memo of proceedings which will also indicate whether he has availed of this option. While these preparations are proceeding the tracker of other witness who is to be asked to identify the tracks shall be prevented from approaching the place or seeing any foot-prints of the persons joining the test parade. When all preparations are complete, the tracker or the identifying witness shall be called up and required to examine both the original tracks whether lifted on the moulds or otherwise and those on the test ground and hereafter to make his statement. The Magistrate or the person conducting the test, shall record the statement of the tracker or the identifying witness as to the grounds of his claim to identify the tracks, and shall put such other questions as he may deem proper to test his bona-fides. Neither any Police Officer nor any person connected with the case shall be allowed to take any part in the conduct of the test. The persons other than the Magistrate conducting the test may, however, associate with them one or more independent witnesses of reliable character. If the tracks of culprits found at the scene of crime are shortfooted, the Magistrate or the other person conducting the parade, shall be requested to take the shoes into possession, paste their signed paper slip on the shoes and seal them after the parade. When admitting the accused or suspect whose track parade is to be held, in Jail a request in writing shall be made to the Jail authorities to see that the accused or suspect does not change the soles. At the time of arrest in such cases, the Police Officer making or ordering the arrest will take the shoes of the accused in possession, paste a chit signed by himself and witness on it and seal them. The parcel will be opened by the Magistrate or other person conducting the parade and resealed after the parade as above. If, however, the tracker, for any reason such as inefficiency, carelessness, confusion or adverse influence of the suspect, fails to correctly identify the tracks, the matter should not be left there. It is still open to the Investigator, if another more efficient and reliable tracker is not available, to get the moulds for foot-prints found at the scene of crime and those prepared and duly initialled by the Magistrate or other person holding the parade at the time of the tracks identification parade, compared by the Director, CID, Scientific Laboratory, Phillaur, and obtain his expert opinion as to whether the foot impressions in both the moulds tally. Tracks which it is desired to test by comparison as above, shall be protected immediately on discovery, and their nature, measurements and peculiarities shall be recorded at the time in the case diary of the investigating officer. The details of the preparation of the test ground and the actions required of the suspect and those with whom his tracks are mixed must vary according to the circumstances of the case. The person conducting the test shall so arrange that the identifying witness may be given a fair chance, but under the strictest safeguards, of comparing the original tracks with other track, made on similar ground and in similar conditions. Before inviting person other than the Magistrate to conduct the proceedings, the Police Officer concerned will ensure that he is not interested in or against the suspect or accused.] (3) The evidence of a tracker or other experts described in the foregoing rule can be substantiated by the preparation of moulds of other footprints of the criminal or criminals found at the scene of the crime. The method of making moulds of footprints by means of plaster of Paris or a composition of two parts of resin to one part of wax or paraffin is taught to all students at the Police Training School but requires practice before an officer can become proficient. The only advantage in the first method (plaster of Paris) is the quickness with which the material sets. Resin and wax are cheap and can be used more than once. In making moulds for production as evidence the following precautions should be observed:Investigation 705 (a) The footprints found on the scene of the crime must be pointed out to police witnesses at the time and these same witnesses must be present during the preparation of the moulds. (b) The latter must also be signed or marked by the witnesses and the officer preparing them while still setting. (c) After the procedure described in sub-rule (2) above has been completed a mould should be prepared in the presence of the magistrate or witnesses of one of the foot-prints of the suspect made in their presence. This mould should be signed by the Magistrate or witnesses when still setting. (d) Both moulds should be carefully preserved for production in court for identification by witnesses and comparison by the Court. Methods of recording footprints. - (1) by tracking through glass footprints found on the ground or other surface, and (2) by taking impressions of feet direct on to paper, as in the case of finger impressions, are taught at the Police Training School. Such records shall utilized in the case of notorious criminals for comparison with footprints found at the scene of offence. They may also be used to check the reliability of local trackers.

In every case where death appears to have been due to suicidal, homicidal, accidental or suspicious causes and where any doubt exists as to the exact cause of death, or if it appears to the officer conducting the investigation - whether under Section 157 or Section 174, Code of Criminal Procedure - expedient to do so, the body shall be sent to the nearest medical officer authorized by the Local Government to conduct post-mortem examinations. The sending of bodies for examination may only be dispensed with, where such action is otherwise required when conditions exist, such as advanced putrefaction, which would clearly make examination useless. (2) An investigating officer is empowered by law with the discretion to dispense with a surgical examination of the body - (a) if he is fully satisfied that the cause of death is established beyond doubt, (b) in the circumstances described at the end of the preceding sub-rule. In regard to the former condition, it must be remembered that the existence of 710 Punjab Police Rules, 1934 Volume 3, CHAPTER 25 an apparently fatal wound does not necessarily establish the cause of death. In cases where investigation establishes the accidental nature of the event which led to the death and the history of the deceased and of the case suggests no reason to suspect that expert examination of the body will reveal any cause of death other than the apparent one, such examination may be dispensed with. In all cases where suspicion exists that the death was due either to suicide or to an act rendering the perpetrator thereof liable to a criminal charge the body must be examined by a qualified medical officer, if possible. (3) The law requires that the body shall be sent to the nearest qualified medical officer, and the orders of the Local Government prohibit the summoning of such officer to conduct his examination at or near the scene of the death save in exceptional cases. These may occur, where, owing to advanced putrefaction or the circumstances in which the corpse was found, movement of corpse may make it impossible for the medical officer to form a correct opinion as to the nature of the injuries or the exact cause of death. In such cases if the investigating officer considers expert post-mortem examination essential in the interests of justice, he shall report the facts by most expeditious means available to the Superintendent of Police or gazetted officer in charge of the case, with a request that a qualified officer shall be sent to the spot. If the officer receiving this report endorses the opinion of the Investigating Officer, he shall request the District Magistrate or the next senior Magistrate in the absence of District Magistrate from headquarters to give orders for the medical examination of the body at the scene of death. (4) In cases where it is impossible either to send a body to a qualified medical officer or to have it examined by such officer on the spot, the investigating officer may, at his discretion, request the nearest Government medical officer, even though such officer be not authorized to conduct post- mortem examination, to assist him with his anatomical and other expert knowledge in estimating the effects and causes of injuries, etc. Such medical officers are not empowered to perform any operation on the body.

Any such procedure is liable to vitiate the subsequent investigation of the case in the laboratory of the Chemical Examiner.

No court of law could be expected to attach much weight to the finding of human blood on the nails of the accused. (6) Stomach tubes in hospitals are frequently kept in a solution of mercury. They should be carefully washed with water before use. Traces of mercury found along with another poison in stomach contents might produce such complications as would handicap the successful prosecution of a case. (7) Carbon copies of reports are sometimes very difficult to read and should be prepared clearly.

Note. - Section 58 and this rule project also sources of information relating to past acts of commission of such crimes, and to past conspiracies, preparations, and attempts to commit such crimes. 2. The provisions of rule 1 shall not apply to a disclosure or communication by a police officer to another member of the same force who is authorized by the Inspector-General of Police either by a general or special direction in this behalf to require or receive such disclosure or communication. In giving general or special direction the Inspector-General of Police shall be under the general control of and comply with such instructions as may from time to time be given to him by the Governor in his discretion. 3. The provisions of rule 1 shall not apply to a disclosure or communication by a police officer to any person (not being a member of the same force) who is authorised by the Governor in his discretion either by a general or special direction in this behalf to receive such disclosure or communication. 4. The provisions of rule 1 shall not apply to a disclosure or communication by a servant of the Crown (not being a police officer) to any person who is authorized by the Governor in his discretion either by a general or special direction in this behalf to receive such disclosure or communication. 5. The provisions of rule 1 shall not apply to a disclosure or communication by any servant of the Crown (not being a police officer) of acts ascertained by himself made to a Superintendent of Police or District Magistrate of a district or to an officer of Criminal Investigation Department of or above the rank of Sub-Inspector or to any police officer conducting an investigation under the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898. 6. The provisions of Rule 1 shall not affect the procedure followed by a police officer making an investigation under Chapter XIV of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898. 7. The Inspector-General of Police shall, with the previous approval of the Governor in his discretion give directions as to the custody of the records or any other documents containing such information as is referred to in rule (1), and the person or persons in whose custody such records or documents are kept shall not disclose them to any person except in accordance with these directions. 8. If in the interests of the administration it is considered necessary by any police officer in possession of any such record or information that such record or information should be disclosed or given to any person other than a police officer serving under the Punjab Government, he shall refer the matter to the Governor through the Inspector-General of Police, and the decision of the Governor in his discretion shall be final. 9. If any person in the service of the Crown in the province other than a police officer considers it necessary in the interests of the administration that such record or information should be disclosed or given to any person, he shall refer the matter to the Governor, and the decision of the Governor in his discretion shall be final. 10. A servant of the Crown who is in doubt whether in any particular case he is compelled by, or permitted under the provisions of these rules to make a disclosure or communication may before making the disclosure or communication require that the matter be referred for direction by the Inspector General of Police or the Governor in his discretion, as the case may be. 4. The above principles apply equally to Council questions. The great majority of these Investigation 721 can be disposed of without reference to local officers. Sometimes when a question consists of several parts, a reference to local officers is necessary only in regard to one or two of these parts. Where a reference is made, it should be stated in regard to which parts information is required. Further, where a question asks for information which will require considerable time and labour for its collection, local officers should not be asked to supply this information, unless the Secretary concerned is satisfied that the information may reasonably be given in spite of the time and labour involved. Where he does not think that this is the case, he should obtain the orders of the Member or Minister concerned before starting inquiries which may later prove unnecessary. When it is decided not to collect information required to answer a council question the proper answer is - ‘‘It is not in the public interest to collect this information.’’ 5. In order to secure that the above orders are observed, the following procedure is prescribed:(i) Except in purely routine matters, no reference to Commissioners or Deputy Commissioners should be made without the approval of a gazetted officer. Important reference should receive the approval of the Secretary or the Head of the Department concerned, unless they are of an immediate nature and the approval of the Secretary or Head of the Department cannot be obtained without delay. (ii) Commissioners of Divisions should bring to the notice of the Chief Secretary by demi-official letter cases in which unnecessary references are made or inadequate time is given for the disposal of unnecessary references. The Chief Secretary will submit the reference of the Commissioner to the Member or Minister concerned, who will no doubt wish to satisfy himself that the orders of Government have been obtained. 6. The above orders relate primarily to references to Commissioners and Deputy Commissioners. They will also apply mutatis mutations to references by the Secretariat and Heads of Departments to another administrative and executive officers, e.g., in the Irrigation Branch of the Public Works Department they will apply to references by the Secretariat to Superintending and Executive Engineers; in the Agriculture Department they will apply to references by the office of the Director of Agriculture to Deputy Directors of Agriculture and to Extra Assistant Directors of Agriculture, and so on. 7. In order that the foregoing instructions are not lost sight of, they should be embodied in departmental Manuals. Yours sincerely, F.H. PUCKLE, Chief Secretary to Government, Punjab. To (i) All Heads of Departments in the Punjab. (ii) The Registrar, High Court of Judicature at Lahore. (iii) All Commissioners of Divisions, Deputy Commissioners and District and Sessions Judges in the Punjab. 722 Punjab Police Rules, 1934 Volume 3, CHAPTER 25 subject of taking and recording statements and confessions of accused persons should be observed:Confessions and statements of accused persons The provisions of Sections 164, 342 and 364 of the Criminal Procedure Code with regard to the confessions and statements of accused persons should be carefully studied. Section 164 deals with the recording of statements and confessions at any stage before the commencement of an enquiry or trial. Section 342 deals with the examination of accused persons during the course of the enquiry or trial. Section 364 prescribes the manner in which the examination of accused persons is to be recorded. 2. The object of section 164, Criminal Procedure Code, is to provide a method of securing a reliable record of statements or confessions made during the course of the police investigation, which could be used, if necessary, during the enquiry or trial. Under Section 25 of the Indiana Evidence Act, a confession to a police officer is inadmissible in evidence, and hence when an accused person confesses during police investigation the police frequently get it recorded by a Magistrate under Section 164, Criminal Procedure Code, and it can then be used to the extent to which it may be admissible under the Indian Evidence Act. 3. Under section 80 of the Indian Evidence Act, a Court is bound to presume that a statement of confession of an accused person taken in accordance with law and purporting to be signed by any judge or Magistrate is genuine, and that the certificate or note as to the circumstances under which it was taken, purporting to be made by the persons signing it, are true, and that such statement or confession was duly taken. The words ‘‘taken in accordance with law’’ occurring this section are very important and it is essential that in recording a statement or confession under section 164, the provisions of that section should be strictly followed. Some important changes were made in the section in 1923 and the form of the certificate to be attached to the statements and confessions was also altered. The evidential value of a confession depends upon its voluntary character and the precision with which it is reproduced and hence the section provides safeguards to secure this end. These safeguards are of great importance as confessions are often retracted at a later stage and it becomes necessary for the Court to ascertain whether the alleged confession was actually and voluntarily made. The mere fact that a confession is retracted does not render it inadmissible in evidence, but the Court has to scrutinise any such confession with the utmost care and accept it with the greatest caution. Experience and common sense in fact show that in the absence of some material corroboration it is not safe to convict merely on a retracted confession, unless from the peculiar circumstances under which it was made and judging from the reasons, alleged or apparent, of retraction there remains a high degree of certainty that the confession, notwithstanding its having been resiled from, is genuine (cf.30 P.R. 1994 (Cr.)). 4. Some important features of section 164 as it stands now are:(a) Statements or confessions made in the courses of an investigation can be recorded only by a magistrate of the first class or a magistrate of the second class who has been specially empowered by the Local Government. (b) Confessions must be recorded and signed in the manner provided in Section 364. (c) Before recording any such confession the magistrate shall explain to the person making it that he is not bound to make a confession, and that if he does so it may be used in evidence against him. (d) No magistrate shall record any such confession unless upon questioning the person making it, he has reason to believe that it was made voluntarily; failure to question has been held to vitiate the confession (I.L.R. 2 Lah. 325). (e) The memorandum set forth in Section 164(3) must be appended at the foot of the record of the confession. Investigation 723 (f) It is not necessary that the magistrate receiving or recording a confession or statement should be a magistrate having jurisdiction in the case. 5. The annexed form for recording confessions taken under section 164 has been prescribed and should invariably be used. 6. Unless there are exceptional reasons to the contrary confessions should be recorded in open court and during court hours, Police officers investigating the case should not be present. 7. An accused person who has been produced for the purpose of making a confession and has declined to do so, or has made a statement which is unsatisfactory from the point of view of the prosecution, should, in no circumstances, be remanded to police custody. 8. Section 342 of the Code empowers to the Court to put questions to the accused at any stage of enquiry or trial to enable him to explain any circumstances appearing in evidence against him. The questions put under this section must be confined to the points brought out in the evidence and should not be in the nature of cross-examination of the accused person. Nor should the power given by the section be used to elicit information from the accused to fill up gaps in the prosecution evidence (cf. I.L.R. 4 Lah. 55). For the conviction of an accused person can only be based on the evidence produced by the prosecution. No oath can be administered to the accused and the answers given by him can only be taken into consideration in explanation of the prosecution evidence. 8-A. The magistrate is allowed by section 342 of the Code of Criminal Procedure to examine the accused at an early stage of the case for the purpose of enabling him to explain any circumstances appearing in the evidence against him. This provision is intended for the benefit of the accused, and must not be used to elicit his defence before the prosecution evidence is complete. Magistrates sometimes question the accused generally on the case as soon as a prima facie case has been made out, but before the prosecution evidence is complete. This is incorrect. According to the second part of clause (1) of section 342, it is only after the completion of the prosecution evidence that the accused can be questioned generally on the case. The necessity for postponing such examination is not avoided by framing a charge at an early stage. Even when a charge has been framed, the magistrate should wait until the prosecution evidence is concluded before making a general examination of the accused. 9. Section 342 makes it obligatory for Court to examine the accused generally on the case after the witnesses for the prosecution have been examined and before the accused is called for his defence. Even when an accused person has been examined at an earlier stage the Court must examine the accused generally after the close of the prosecution case (i.e., after the examination and cross-examination of prosecution witness and their further cross-examination, if any, after the charge is framed) and before the accused is called upon to produce his defence so as to give him an opportunity to explain any points which were not included in the questions put to him at earlier stages. Failure to examine the accused at the close of the prosecution evidence has been held to be an illegality which vitiates the trial (vide 7 I.L.R. Lah. 564). 10. Under section 256 of the Code, if the accused person puts in a written statement, it should be filed with the record. But a written statement of this kind does not relieve the Court of the duty of examining the accused in Court after the close of the prosecution evidence as laid down in section 342. 11. Section 364 provides the mode in which the examination of an accused person is recorded. The questions put to the accused and the answers given by him should be distinctly and accurately recorded. The examination of the accused should be recorded in the language in which he is examined, and, if that is not practicable, in the language of the Court or in English. In cases in which examination is not recorded by the magistrate or Judge himself he must record a Memo. thereof in the language by the Court or in English 724 Punjab Police Rules, 1934 Volume 3, CHAPTER 25 if he is sufficiently acquainted with the latter language. The examination must be read over to the accused and made conformable to what he declares to be the truth. The Magistrate or Judge must then certify under his own hand that the examination was taken down in his presence and hearing, and that the record contains a full and true account of what was stated. 12. Under Section 533 of the Code, if any court, before which a confession or other statement of an accused person recorded or purporting to be recorded under section 164, or section 364, is intended, or has been received in evidence, finds that any of the provisions of either of such sections have not been complied with by the magistrate recording the statement it must take evidence that such person duly made the statement recorded and such a statement may then become admissible in evidence notwithstanding the provisions of Section 91 of the Indian Evidence Act, provided the error has not prejudiced the accused as to his defence on merits. ------------------Investigation 725 RECORD OF A CONFESSION MADE BY AN ACCUSED PERSON.

If the answers are of such a character as to require him to do so, he should put such further questions as may be necessary to enable him to judge whether the accused person is acting voluntarily. In arriving at his conclusion on this point the Magistrate should consider inter alia the period during which the accused person has been in police custody and make sure that the confession is not the result of any undue influence or ill treatment.

Wide mouthed bottles or jars of sufficient size must be used, otherwise the contents readily decompose. It is also difficult to empty narrowmounted bottles or jars that are tightly packed. II. Materials that are liable to decompose should be preserved by one of the following methods:(1) In cases of suspected human poisoning other than alcohol, phosphorus, carbolic acid and some of the lesser known volatile poisons, the material sent should be immersed in rectified spirit. The spirit should be sufficient to cover the material immersed in whatever position the vessel containing it may be held. On no account use common bazar spirit. A separate four ounce bottle of the rectified spirit added should be sent for independent analysis as a control. (2) In those cases mentioned above where rectified spirit should not be added, the preservative used should be salt solution and the same precautions for immersion of material should be exercised. A salt solution is made by adding a full tablespoonful of salt to about a pint of fresh clean water. A separate four ounce bottle of this salt solution should be sent for independent analysis as a control. (3) If two or more examinations have to be made on the same occasion, the medical officer should complete one and label and seal the articles connected with it before commencing a second examination, otherwise there is risk of the viscera, etc., of one case getting mixed with those of another. He should clean his instruments and vessels before commencing the second case. (4) In cases of suspected cattle poisoning, the viscera or other material should be preserved in rectified spirit with the same precautions as those exercised in human poisoning cases (item 2). (5) It is advisable to keep a sample of the preservative added under lock and key in case the bottle containing the sample sent to the Chemical Examiner should arrive broken. III. Great care should be taken that the stopper or cork of the bottle or jar fits tightly; especially is this necessary during the hot weather, when rectified spirit is added as a preservative. The stopper may first be candle-waxed and then carefully tied down with leather or water proof and sealed. IV. To secure identity, the bottles or jars should be properly labelled with a list of the contents. V. The bottles or jars should then be placed in a strong wooden box with plenty of packing material to ensure against any breakages during transit. Saw dust, cotton wool, and dried grass are suitable for this purpose. Old office papers, etc., should not be used as the copies of the forwarding documents enclosed in the box are liable to be thrown away with this waste paper packing material. Keep these documents well away from the bottles as breakages or leakages are apt to stain them. VI. The box itself should be covered with common garha cloth properly sewed and Investigation 729 sealed. Seals should be at short intervals of three inches along each line of sewing. All the seals must be similar and preferably the wax should be of the same kind. The seal used should be the ordinary office seal and must be kept under lock and key. Current coins, or a series of straight, curved or crossed lines must not be used as seals. The box should be properly addressed and sufficient stamps added to cover postage; the box must also be franked. VII. Under no circumstances should viscera from different cases be included in the same parcel. VIII. The despatching officer who is invariably the Civil Surgeon or another medical officer authorised to conduct post-mortem examination, is personally responsible that these instruction are carefully followed. Note. - In order to minimise the chances of parcels being lost in transit between the office of the Chemical Examiner and the Railway Station at Lahore, all articles for medico-legal examination should be sent by post as far as possible or better still by hand. IX. In cases where the police send a closed parcel through the medical officer and the latter has no occasion to open it in transmission, the parcel should be packed in a second cloth cover and the forwarding memo., should also be enclosed. This procedure is necessary and prevents cases getting mixed up on receipt of the Chemical Examiner’s office. X. The labelling and numbering of articles should not be in the vernacular but in English. XI. A declaration of the contents to the Postal authorities is unnecessary. 730 Punjab Police Rules, 1934 Volume 3, CHAPTER 25 (b) Amatol. - Is s mixture of tri-nitro-toluene and ammonium nitrate. In appearance it is a brown paste. (8) Chlorate of potash. - May be found in clear tabular crystals or as a white powder. (9) Sulphide of arsenic. - Is generally found as a yellow or orange powder. (10) Carbide or phosphide of calcium. - Under certain circumstances these may cause violent explosion. (11) Detonators and caps. - These are explosives made up in metal tubes or small metal caps. Military detonators, friction tubes and time fuzes are made in a great variety of forms. All detonation should be handled with the utmost care. (12) Fuse. - This is slow burning gunpowder rolled up in cloth or paper in the form of long cards. Military fuses are made up in metal bodies in great variety of forms. (13) Cartridges. - Thee are either commercial, military or sporting and generally contain their own means of ignition in the form of a cap or primer. Cartridges for big guns generally consist of explosives made up in silk cloth or shalloon bags or bundles. (14) Bombs. - These are explosives contained in receptacles such as bottles, jars, coconut shells, cloth, jute or hemp, balls or bundles, books letters tins, metal shells, bamboo tubes, water cistern floats, chatties, etc., the whole being designed to explode by percussion, fuse, trigger, by being inverted, etc. (15) Fireworks. - Fireworks are provided with a fuse of touch papers or slow match. Throwdowns, crackers, explosives, corks, or objects designed to explode by percussion, provided they are not detonators, caps or cartridges are not fireworks, but bombs. (16) Rockets. - Some rockets are not fireworks. Life saving, signal and military rockets are dangerous and should be handled with care. (17) Signals. - These may be ships-flares, signal lights, etc. They are not fireworks. C. Gases. - Liquid or compressed gases (ammonia, oxygen, hydrogen, acetylene, carbon-di-oxide) in cylinders, sparklets, etc., may under certain circumstances cause violent explosion. Instructions. A local police officer should communicate at once with the Superintendent of Police, who will himself proceed, or depute some responsible officer to proceed, to the place to carry out the following instructions:1. If you have any reason, however slight, to suspect that the substance or object with which you, are dealing is dangerous then regard it as being Highly Explosive until such time as it is proved to be otherwise. 2. * * * * * * * * * * 3. During the removal, guarding or examination of any substances or object suspected of being explosive, all unnecessary persons whether police or otherwise should be sent away. 4. If the substance you are examining is Liquid, proceed as in paragraphs 6 or 7. Solid, proceed as in paragraphs 8, 9 or 10. Gas, proceed as in paragraph 11. 5. If the object you are examining is a Investigation 731 Detronator or cap.,  Fuse,  Cartidge,  proceed as in paragraph 12 Firework,  Rocket,  Signal light  Bomb, proceed as in paragraph 13. 6.(1) If the substance is a liquid in an open vessel Carefully dip into the liquid a pencil or thin piece of stick and allow one drop to fall on a small piece of blotting paper or tin foil (silver paper). Remove this ten yards or more from the vessel or vessels containing the bulk of the liquid, place it upon a flat surface or iron or stone and strike it a sharp glancing blow with a flat headed hammer. Repeat the test three times with fresh drops and also by burning a fresh drip of the liquid on the blotting paper in the flame of a spirit lamp or candle. (A) The substance explodes or burns rapidly. Place about half an ounce of the liquid in a small clean bottle, carefully cork it up (do not use a glass or metal stopper), and after packing in cotton wool in a box or tin, send it by messenger to the Inspector of Explosives, Northern India, with your report. The bulk of the liquid should be locked up in an isolated place until instructions are received from the Inspector of Explosives, Northern India, as to its disposal. (B) The substance does not explode or burn rapidly. Place about half an ounce of the liquid in a small clean bottle, cork up and after packing send by post to the Inspector of Explosives, Northern India, with your report, the bulk of the liquid should be locked up in any convenient place until the report of the Inspector of Explosives is received. 7. (2) When the substance is a liquid in a closed vessel (1) If the vessel is a bottle and is not suspected of being a bomb and the stopper will not come out when using only moderate power, do not attempt to open but send it by messenger to the nearest Inspector of Explosives together with your report, first having carefully packed the bottle upright in a box with straw, sawdust, or paper, etc. (2) If the vessel is a bottle and is not suspected of being a bomb and the stopper will come out, then proceed as in paragraph 6. (3) If the vessel is not suspected of being a bomb and is of metal or other hard material and the stopper will not come out when moderate force is used, do not attempt to open but remove the vessel very gently, and in such a manner as to explose it to as little shanking as possible, and without turning it over in any way, to such open place of safety in the vicinity as may be available, where its ignition or explosion would be attended with a minimum of mischief, e.g, a yard or a garden or other open space from which the public are or can be excluded. The two pieces of strong cord to the vessel passing one cord round a hook or tree and from round the corner of a building and after all persons have been removed from within range, pull the cords backward and forward so that the vessel is upset and given as severe a shaking as possible, then leave the vessel alone for twelve hours. If explosion is not obtained and the vessel is not too large send it by messenger to the Inspector of Explosives with your report. If the vessel is a large one, try once more to open it using more force. If you cannot open it, remove the vessel to a convenient place where it can be locked up and send a copy of your report and all connected papers to the Inspector of Explosives. 732 Punjab Police Rules, 1934 Volume 3, CHAPTER 25 8. When the substance is a solid in an open vessel (1) Carefully take out with a piece of cardboard or flat stick a few grains of the solid and after removing it ten yards, or more away from the vessel or vessels containing the bulk of the substance, place it upon a flat surface or iron or stone and strike it a sharp glancing blow with a flat headed hammer. Repeat the test three times with fresh substance and also try burning a small portion on blotting paper in the flame of a spirit lamp or candle. (A) The substance explodes or burns rapidly. - Take a very small amount of the substance, add to it a little water and notice what happens. If the substance undergoes no change and there is no sign of any gas being given off, or of heat being generated, place about half an ounce of the substance in a small clean bottle and fill up with clean water. Cork the bottle carefully, taking the precaution not to use a glass or metal stopper, and then pack it in cotton wool in a box or tin and send it by messenger to the Inspector of Explosives with your report. The bulk of the substance should then be covered with clean water and locked up in a isolated place until instructions are received from the Inspector of Explosives as to its disposal. (B) The substance does not explode or burn rapidly. - Test a small amount of the substance with water in exactly the same way as detailed in (A). If the substance undergoes no change and there is no sign of any gas being given off, or of heat being generated, place about half an ounce of the substance in a small clean bottle and fill up with water. Cork the bottle carefully, and after packing, send it by post to the Inspector of Explosives with your report. The bulk of the substance should then be covered with clean water and locked up in any convenient place until the report of the Inspector of Explosives is received. (2) If you find that the substance under sub-paragraphs (A) and (B) does undergo a change, etc., when water is added proceed exactly as before, except that the sample in all cases should be sent dry, and the bulk also kept dry. Make certain that your bottle is absolutely dry before you put the sample into it. 9. When the substance is a solid in a closed vessel (1) If the vessel is a bottle and is not suspected of being a bomb and the stopper will not come out when only moderate power is used. Do not attempt to open it but send it by messenger to the Inspector of Explosives together with your report, first having carefully packed the bottle upright in a box with straw, sawdust, paper, etc. (2) If the vessel is a bottle and is not suspected of being a bomb and the stopper will come out then proceed as in 8. (3) If the vessel is not suspected of being a bomb and is of metal or other hard material proceed as in 7(2). 10. When the substance is calcium carbide or calcium phosphide. - If it is desired to destroy calcium carbide or calcium phosphide, this can be done by dropping them into deep water, but not more than half a pound at a time, waiting until no more gas is given off before a fresh portion is destroyed. 11. When the substances is a gas. - Gases are generally found compressed in cylinders, sparklets, etc. They should be kept cool and away from the direct rays of the sun. If it is desired to know what gas is in any cylinder, the whole cylinder should be even up in the coir matting and sent by train to the Inspector of Explosives together with your report. Small cylinders or sparklets only a few inches long can be sent by post if well packed in cotton wool in a wooden box. 12. When the object is a detonator, cap, fuse, cartridge, firework, rocket, light, these should never, under any circumstances, be sent through the post. A few should be careInvestigation 733 fully packed separately in cotton wool in a wooden box and be sent by hand to the Inspector of Explosives together with your report. The bulk should be locked up in an isolated place. 13. When the object is a bomb (1) These may be met with in the following forms:A. Military grenades. B. Copies of military grenades. C. Bombs made up in soda bottles, jam tins, water cistern floats, chatties, coconut shells, bundles of jute or hemp, bamboo tubes, etc. D. Book bombs. E. Letter bombs. (2) Any of these may be designed to explode (a) when moved in any way, (b) when turned over, (c) when placed in water, (d) when thrown down, (e) by lighting a fuse, (f) by clockwork, (g) by chemical reaction. (3) Before touching the bomb examine it where it lies and see if you can detect the arrangement for firing. See if there is any trigger and, if so, if it is set or not. Do not move the bomb, unless you are satisfied that it is safe to do so. If you are not satisfied, then place a guard over the bomb and report to your senior officer. A. Military grenades. - The first thing to do, is to see that the safety pin is in position, that it is not broken or corroded and that the ends are well splayed out so that it cannot be jolted out. See that the jaws of the laver are in good condition and support the striker correctly. Being satisfied on these points, the base should be unscrewed and, if the igniter set is present, it should be carefully removed. Pack the igniter set and the bomb in cotton wool in separate wooden boxes and send by hand to the Inspector of Explosives, together with your report. If the safety pin and level are missing and the striker is inside the bomb, it will probably have to be destroyed in situ. Set a guard over it where it lies and report to your senior officer. B. Copies of military grenades. - These are generally something like a military grenade but are of cruder finish. They must only be handled by persons who have handled bombs before. It is generally possible to render them harmless by removing an explosive cap or tuft of gun cotton. This should only be done with you are satisfied that the trigger is safe. Do not put this type of bomb in water but, provided the trigger has been made safe, it should be packed in cotton wool in a wooden box and be sent by the hand to the Inspector of Explosives together with your report. C. Bombs made up in soda bottles, etc. - First arrange a string bag and strong cord over a large bucket of hot water. Carefully remove the bomb keeping it in the same position as found and place it in the bag and from round the corner of a building, first having sent everybody present under cover lower the bomb into the hot water and leave it there for 24 hours. The water will then be cold. It may then be taken out and be carefully packed in wet straw or cotton wool in a 734 Punjab Police Rules, 1934 Volume 3, CHAPTER 25 wooden box and be sent by hand to the Inspector of Explosives together with your report. If the bomb is well made and there is a possibility that the water may not have penetrated inside, it should be given the rough treatment described in paragraph 7(3) before being sent away. D. Book bombs. - These are bombs made up in book form and are generally designed to explode when the book is opened or turned over. Such a bomb should be very carefully taken to an isolated place, keeping it in the original position all the time and be locked up. Send a report on the subject to the Inspector of Explosives. E. Letter bombs. - These are letters containing explosives which are designed to explode when opened. Place the whole letter in a bucket of water. When the letter is quite wet, pack it in a tin in wet cotton wool and send by hand to the Inspector of Explosives, together with your report. F. Booby Traps. 1. ‘‘Booby Traps’’ are bomb generally designed to explode in the presence of an officer who is engaged in searching suspected premises. 2. They may be designed to explode when the bomb is moved in any way or electric contract is made by some action of the officer or by clock work or chemical means. 3. The most prevalent procedure is to cause one bomb to explode in a house by time fuse, such as a burning candle, leaving a second bomb which will explode when the officer comes to investigate the first explosion, or the officer may be tempted to the house by a message, telephone call etc. 4. Another method is to leave the second bomb with an obvious means of ignition such as a burning candle in the hope that the officer will extinguish the candle and then consider the bomb as safe whereas it is really designed to explode if moved in any way. 5. Never enter a house or room in which you suspect booby traps by the obvious way. First smash a window or knock a hole in the wall with a crowbar opposite the door to se if the door can be safely opened. 6. Enter the house or room very slowly touching nothing until each object has been carefully examined. Make a loop at the end of a long rope and drop the loop over each object which might be a bomb without touching it. These may be such things as tins, trunks, kettles, lamps, buckets, boxes, clocks, etc. From outside the room or house jerk the object about by means of the rope and do not enter the room or house again for some minutes in each case. Open the lids of boxes or trunks by means of the rope from round the corner. 7. If an unexploded bomb is discovered after this treatment proceed as in paragraph C above. -------------------Investigation 735 736 Punjab Police Rules, 1934 Volume 3, CHAPTER 25 unless it is made clear that his presence is actually needed in order to serve some important and specific purpose connected with the completion of the enquiry. A general statement by the officer applying for the remand that the accused may be able to give further information should not be accepted. (ii) When an accused person is remanded to police custody the period of the remand should be as short as possible. (iii) In all ordinary cases in which time is required by the police to complete the enquiry, the accused person should be detained in magisterial custody. (iv) Where the object of the remand is merely the verification of the prisoner’s statement, he should be remanded to magisterial custody. (v) A prisoner, who has been produced for the purpose of making a confession and who has declined to do so, or has made a statement which is unsatisfactory from the point of view of the prosecution should in no circumstances be remanded to police custody. 3. In any case when an accused person is remanded to police custody, the reasons must be recorded in the order of remand, and when the Magistrate ordering a remand is not himself a Sub-Divisional or District magistrate, he must at once send a copy of his order, with his reasons for making it, to the Sub-Divisional or District Magistrate to whom he is immediately subordinate. If the limit of 15 days has elapsed, and there is still need for further investigation by the police, the procedure to be adopted is that laid down in section 344, Criminal Procedure Code. The case is brought on to the magistrate’s file, and the accused, if detention is necessary, will remain in magisterial custody. The case may be postponed or adjourned from time to time for periods of not more than 15 days each, and as each adjournment expires the accused must be produced before the magistrate, and the order of adjournment must show good reasons for making the order.

The law provides, however, no penalty for merely evading arrest by a police officer, though it penalises resistance to, or escape from, such arrest. On the other hand the law does provide a severe penalty or recalcitrance to an order in the form of a warrant by a Court, entirely irrespective of the evidence of the guilt of the person against whom the warrant is issued. For merely evading obedience to a warrant of arrest, a man is liable to proclamation and the confiscation of his property and any one who harbours him, as defined in section 52-A of the Indian Penal Code, can also be severely punished. Whenever, therefore, a person is wanted, whose whereabouts are not immediately known, the notice shall, before setting off in search of him, obtain a warrant of arrest from the Court having jurisdiction. Unsuccessful search without such a warrant is merely waste of time. On the other hand immediately it is found that, in spite of all reasonable effort, a warrant cannot be executed, a proclamation order under section 87, Criminal Procedure Code, can be obtained and, on proclamation being duly carried out, attachment under section 88, Criminal Procedure Code, can immediately follow, and connivance by any person at the continued absconding of the person proclaimed becomes punishable under section 216, Indian Penal Code.

(2) If a telegram is received by a police officer requesting him to arrest a person for an offence which appears to such police officer to be non- cognizable he shall lay information before a magistrate having jurisdiction with a view to the issue of a summons or warrant. If such magistrate declines to issue a summons or warrant the orders of the District Magistrate shall be sought. (3) A police officer who despatches a telegram to another police officer requesting him to arrest a person without warrant shall be responsible that the information in his possession is sufficient to justify, and that the police officer addressed has jurisdiction to make such arrest.

The Indian Extradition Act XV of 1903 governs arrests and extradition from British India to India States. Detailed instructions regarding the extradition of criminals and foreign jurisdiction and the application of the Indian Extradiction Act are contained in Chapter 16, Volume III, Rules and Orders of the High Court of Judicature of Lahore. (2) The powers of pursuit of offenders conferred by section 58, Criminal Procedure Code do not cover pursuit into the territory of an Indian State; established custom and usage in respect of the relations between the British Government and such States, however, permits such pursuit, and requires the authorities of the States concerned to render all possible assistance in investigating cases, following up offenders and effecting their apprehension and detention pending the grant of extradition. Reciprocal arrangements have, however, been made with Jammu-Kashmir, Patiala, Jind, Nabha, Kapurthala, Faridkot, Malerkotla and Bikaner. Rules framed by the Governor-General in Council under the Indian Extradition Act and stated in Foreign and Political Department Notification 750 Punjab Police Rules, 1934 Volume 3, CHAPTER 26 followed. The handing over of accused persons to the police not having such jurisdiction is strictly prohibited. When it is essential for the purposes of an investigation that an accused person should be sent to any place for the purposes of investigation, he shall be taken by the police who are legally entitled to his custody, and they shall be responsible for him in every respect. The attendance of witnesses from one jurisdiction to an investigation in another cannot be enforced. (6) All police officers shall at all times do all in their power to promote friendly relations and a spirit of co-operation with the police of Indian States. In the absence of such relations the limitation of jurisdiction must inevitably have harmful effects on the control of crime. (7) Whenever the police of one jurisdiction demand assistance from the police of another they shall cause an entry to be made in the dialy diary of the police station concerned. Rule 26.11 26.11.

The proceedings shall be conducted by a Magistrate or, if no Magistrate is available and the case is of great urgency then, by Sarpanch who may summon one or two independent and literate, if possible, persons of reliable character, not interested in the case to assist him and to certify that the identification has been conducted under conditions precluding collusion. Such proceedings shall not be conducted by a Police Officer. The Police Officer concerned before inviting a Sarpanch to conduct the proceedings must ensure that the Sarpanch is not biased or interested in or against the accused or suspect and that he understands the rules of the proceedings. Every effort should be made to secure the presence of a Magistrate and services of Sarpanch only secured when absolutely necessary. In the absence of a Sarpanch, a Lambardar may be invited to do the needful.] (b) Arrangements shall be made, whether the proceedings are being held inside a jail or elsewhere, to ensure that the identifying witnesses shall be kept separate from each other and at such a distance from the place of identification as shall render it impossible for them to see the suspects or any of the persons concerned in the proceedings, until they are called up to make their identification. (c) Identification shall be carried out as soon as possible after the arrest of the suspects. (d) The suspects shall be placed among other persons similarly dressed and of the same religion and social status, in the proportion of 8 or 9 such persons to one suspect. Each witness shall then be brought up separately to attempt his identification. Care shall be taken that the remaining witnesses are still kept out of sight and hearing and that no opportunity is permitted for communications to pass between witnesses who have been called up and those who have not. If it is desired, through fear of revenge or for other adequate reasons, that witnesses shall not be seen by the suspects, arrangements shall be made for the former, when called up to stand behind a screen or be otherwise placed so that they can see clearly without being seen. 2[(e)The results of the tests shall be recorded by the Magistrate or other person conducting the test in Form 26.32(1)(e) as each witness views the suspect. On conclusion, the Magistrate or the Sarpanch or the Lambardar and the witnesses, if any, shall sign the form and certify that the test has been carried out correctly 1.

It is advisable that, whenever possible, an independent and reliable person, un-connected with the Police, should be present throughout the proceedings at the place where the witnesses are kept, and should be required to devote his attention to the prevention of collusion. It is important that once the arrangements for the proceedings have been undertaken, no police officer whatsoever shall have any access whatever either to the suspects or to the witnesses.] (2) Proceedings of the nature described above are extra-judicial. It is not the duty of the officer conducting them or of the independent witnesses to record statements or cross-examine either suspects or identifying witnesses, but they should be requested to question the latter as to the circumstances in which they saw the suspect whom they claim to identify, and to record the answer in column 4 of the form. While every precaution shall be taken to prevent collusion, the identifying witnesses must be given a fair chance, and conditions must not be imposed, which would make it impossible for a person honestly capable of making an identification to do so. In this connection attention is invited to paragraph 814 of the Punjab Jail Manual, which strictly prohibits the alteration in any way of the personal appearance of unconvicted prisoners, so as to make it difficult to recognise them. 1 758 Punjab Police Rules, 1934 Volume 3, CHAPTER 26 4.

EXTRACT FROM CHAPTER 3-A, OF VOLUME IV, HIGH COURT RULES AND ORDERS REGARDING THE DUTIES OF THE PROSECUTIN G AGENCY TOWARDS THE DISTRICT MAGISTRATE. (7) A convenient and valuable source of information for the adequate supervision of criminal business is the Police Department English register of cognizable offences mentioned in the Police Rule 24.18(1). This register is placed before the District Magistrate on each working day when he is at district headquarters. It gives information not only of the action of the police (thus enabling the District Magistrate, to superintend their work) but also affords the means of watching the progress and the results of business in Court. The practice of merely intialling this register after a hasty glance at it too commonly prevails, but a few minutes each day spent on considering the entries for the day and for preceding days will enable the District Magistrate to maintain a close touch within all Prosecution and Court Duties. 793 branches of the criminal administration. The entries for the day bring to light at once the orders of courts which are prima facie unsatisfactory and which require the scrutiny of the District Magistrate. The register, therefore, facilitates the making of references to the High Court, and puts the Deputy Commissioner in a position at the earliest possible moment to initiate proceedings by way of appeal. It can also be used to disclose cases which have been pending for an inordinate time. (8) The Deputy Commissioner is the head of the prosecuting agency in the district and this affords him a further opportunity of keeping in touch with the work in all courts. It is easy for him to arrange to be informed by the prosecuting agency each day of an omission on the part of courts to record the evidence of witnesses produced and to investigate promptly any complaint which may be made of dilatoriness in any particular court. (9) * * * * * * * * * (10) The Judges are strongly of opinion that it is necessary to revert to the old system of sending up all material witnesses with the chalan. This system has been resumed in some districts with very marked success, but it can be carried out only if the work of magistrates is so arranged that they shall without delay commence the trial of chalans presented to them by the police. No excuse for not proceeding at once with a chalan should be accepted other than that the magistrate is already engaged on another challan, or on a complaint case in which a postponement would work genuine hardship. In such contingencies the fresh chalan should be proceeded with as soon as the Magistrate is free from the first case, and it must be impressed upon Magistrates that witnesses should be examined at once, that the trial must proceed from day to day without interruption, that charges should be framed without delay and without adjournment for the purpose of considering whether a charge should be framed or not, and that deference should not be paid to the wishes of an unready bar. If the presentation of witnesses along with challans renders it impossible on any particular day to record the statements of witnesses present in complaint cases, the evidence of the latter should be recorded the first thing next morning before the business of that day is undertaken, and similarly on any succeeding day the arrears of the previous day should be disposed of before the set work of that day. In this way it will be possible to avoid retaining any witnesses for more than two days at the utmost. Should congestion occur or be threatened, the Magistrate should apply promptly to the District Magistrate for sanction to fix one or more blank days in the week to be utilized for catching up with arrears, and the District Magistrate will find it convenient to receive each day from the prosecuting inspector a short note showing how the system is working in each of the subordinate courts. (11) All arrests made by the police without warrant are reported to District Magistrate under section 62 of the Criminal Procedure Code, and all remand orders under section 167 passed by subordinate magistrates are similarly reported. Both these reports should be forwarded to the ilaqa magistrate, who has already received the First Information Report. The magistrate of the ilaqa is, thus, in a position to know that crime is under investigation in his ilaqa, and what cases are likely to each his Court within the next few days. The magistrate is responsible that the completion report under section 173 of the Criminal Procedure Code is not unduly delayed, and his responsibility in this respect should be emphazised. He should insist on the prompt submission of the First Information Report and of the arrest report, and he should call for the completion report from the Superintendent of Police if that report is unduly delayed. The District Magistrate should cause the ilaqa magistrate to realize that he is not a mere Judge whose duty it is simply to decide cases produced before him, but that he is at all times responsible for the maintenance of the peace in the area which is made over into his charge. Every effort should be made to get the ilaqa magistrate to take a personal interest in and gain a thorough knowledge of his own thanas. (12) The Deputy Commissioner’s absence in camp must necessarily interfere with his day-to-day supervision of the work of the subordinate courts, but the interference can be 794 Punjab Police Rules, 1934 Volume 3, CHAPTER 27 minimised if arrangements are made with the Superintendent of Police that the register of congnizable crime is submitted each day to the next senior Magistrate at Sadar. That Magistrate, if not exercising the powers of a District Magistrate is not authorized to issue orders to the police but the object is that he should bring immediately to the notice of the District Magistrate cases in which his interference is called for, and in which Magisterial records should be obtained. Similarly the senior magistrate can be entrusted with the duties of securing the punctual attendance of subordinate magistrates and of seeing that witnesses are not dismissed without their evidence being recorded or that chalan cases are not delayed. (13) Not inf4requently cases have occurred where undue delay has taken place in reporting for revision the unsatisfactory orders of subordinate Courts, or in moving Government to institute appeals. The delay is largely due to reliance on the monthly business statements which may not be submitted to the District Magistrate till a considerable time after the objectionable order has been passed. District Magistrates should make free use of the register of cogniazble crime for these purposes, and should take prompt action in cases where such action appears necessary. Having done so, they should arrange to be informed at once of any appeal that may be made to the Sessions Court in a case which has been reported, and they must report promptly to the High Court first the fact of the appeal having been filed and later its results. 796 Punjab Police Rules, 1934 Volume 3, CHAPTER 27 798 Punjab Police Rules, 1934 Volume 3, CHAPTER 27 in effecting arrest; also note whether mentioned in F.I.R. and if not when and how first mentioned _________________________ _________________________________________________________________ [Fresh page] (7) Concise statement of the case for the prosecution.

(e) To keep platforms clear of idlers and beggars and to keep a look-out for suspicious persons, smugglers and persons travelling with arms without a licence. (f) To search all empty carriages for property left behind by passengers. (g) To control the hackney carriages plying for hire at railway stations and to enforce the regulations of the railway authorities with regard to them. (2) It is not the business of the railway police to undertake the watch and ward of railway property or of property consigned to the railway for transportation. For these duties a special force of watchmen is employed and administered by the railway authorities. The railway police shall not be required to intervene in cases of shortage or of missing goods or to examine or check the seals of goods waggons, unless they have reason to suspect the commission of cognizable offences. The provision of guards on goods trains is not one of normal duties of the police and should only be undertaken, if there is definite reason to anticipate the commission of offences. (3) When, however, offences are specially prevalent in any particular locality, the railway police are authorized to take special measures, including the posting of police to goods yards, special seal-checking operations and the investigation of shortages, with the object of detecting such offences and apprehending the offenders.

The Assistant Inspector-General of Railway Police should also keep in touch with District Magistrates and see that the railway police show proper deference to the district authorities. (ii) District Magistrates should, from time to time, examine the registers of railway Railway Police and other Special Rules 813 police stations within their districts and record remarks on such examinations in the Minute Book of the station. Officers in charge of police stations shall send copies of such remarks through their sub-divisional officers to the Assistant Inspector-General who will see that proper action is taken. (iii) Superintendents of district police shall frequently visit railway police stations situated in their districts and satisfy themselves that the orders in connection with the deputation of district policemen to railway stations and co-operation between railway and district police are being properly carried out. They should enter in the Station Minute Book remarks and suggestions in connection with these matters. (iv) All serious crime, including offences of which special reports have, under the police rules to be submitted by district police stations, shall be specially reported at once by the railway police to the Superintendent of district police concerned and to the District Magistrate. The use of the telegraph or telephone for these reports is advisable in cases in which delay would otherwise ensue. (v) Case diaries of the railway police shall be submitted by the railway police officer making the investigation to the sub-divisional officer or Assistant InspectorGeneral of Railway Police, for scrutiny and orders. A copy shall also be sent to the Superintendent of Police of the district within those boundaries the case is registered to enable him to prosecute when necessary; to be available should be magistrate empowered to take cognizance of the offence call for it; and in order that railway cases may be properly placed before the criminal courts. (vi) There are many cases which, although initially and correctly registered in railway police stations, could equally lawfully and more successfully be dealt with by the district police. Cases of murder reported to have occurred within railway jurisdiction fall into this category, if they arise out of district feuds and quarrels or have been committed outside railway limits, the railway line being merely used by the murderers with a view to creating the impression that death has been accidental. Dacoities, robberies and train wrecking, and similar offences, can often be better dealt with by the district police. It is important, therefore, that Superintendents of Police should scrutinize First Information Reports received from railway police stations, and transfer from the railway police jurisdiction, to the district police stations, cases in which such transfer is desirable. (vii) Superintendents of district police shall give the railway police all assistance which they may require in following cases beyond railway limits. The presentation in court and prosecution of railway police cases shall be undertaken by the prosecuting staff of the district concerned with the same degree of energy and supervision as is enjoined upon them in respect of cases registered by the district police. Whenever possible the railway police will provide a special prosecuting officer for important cases and cases which involve railway technicalities, but such action shall not relieve the district police of responsibility for taking all steps in their power to assist the prosecution. (viii) Any defects or irregularities noticed in charge-sheets, and other papers received from the railway police, shall be pointed out by the Superintendent of the district police to the subordinate railway police direct, but no strictures on the railway police shall be passed on such papers. When, in the opinion of the Superintendent of district police, the conduct of the railway police merits reproof he shall address the Assistant Inspector-General of Railway Police on the subject. (ix) If cases which should be, or have been, registered by the railway police are traced by the district police acting independently, information shall immediately be given to the railway police station concerned. (x) When the Assistant Inspector General of Railway Police sends a case for orders 814 Punjab Police Rules, 1934 Volume 3, CHAPTER 28 through a Superintendent of the district police to a magistrate empowered to take cognizance of it, or to a District Magistrate, the Superintendent of Police shall transmit it; he may not return it to the railway police with his own orders, unless and until he has obtained the orders of the magistrate concerned. (xi) When cognizable offences are committed in the vicinity of the railway, but such offences are not required to be investigated by the railway police under these rules, they shall to the utmost of their ability and without neglecting their more immediate duties, use every endeavour to arrest the offender and to assist the district police. (xii) Whenever cognizable crime on the railway is specially prevalent in a particular locality, the Assistant Inspector-General of Railway Police may call on the Superintendent of Police concerned to co-operate with him in checking it. In such circumstances the Superintendent of Police concerned shall make such dispositions as, after a study of the situation, may be agreed upon by himself and the Assistant Inspector-General Railway Police, to be most suitable. If the section of line affected extends beyond the limits of one district, concerted preventive measures shall be instituted after a conference of police officers representing all the areas concerned. (xiii) One or more literate railway police officers of or above the rank of constable shall accompany each passenger train. These officers shall wear uniform throughout their period of duty. They shall maintain a \"Train Diary\" in which will be recorded information connected with cognizable offences, movements of bad characters and suspects and such other matters as may be prescribed. District police stations shall, as far as possible, depute one or more constables in plain clothes to railway stations within the area of their jurisdiction to watch for the arrival or departure by the railway of known criminals or suspicious characters. Such constables shall exchange information with the railway police officers travelling in passenger trains. Information received by this means shall be communicated at the earliest opportunity by the constables concerned to their officers in charge of police stations. If the travelling railway police officer is unable to find the district plain clothes constable during the halt of his train, he shall either make over a written message to the station master and request him to have it delivered or in cases of urgency, he may himself alight and take the message to the district police station. (xiv) Doubtful cases and disputes as to jurisdiction in the case of railway police stations are governed by rule 25.5. The police station receiving a report of a cognizable offence shall record it, according to those rules. Delay in registration and investigation pending the settlement of jurisdiction is expressly forbidden. Rule 28.11",

        "body": "(1) Fixed points for the control of traffic shall be placed only at those crossroads and other places where traffic streams converge or cross in such volume as to make constant regulation necessary. For the enforcement of traffic rules on roads where traffic is not in such volume as to constitute a steady stream either or both of the following two methods shall be employed:(a) Traffic beats. - These beats shall normally consist of two constables, working within sight and signalling distance of each other, but sufficiently far apart for one constable to move out into the centre of the road and stop a vehicle, which the other constable has signalled to him to intercept. (b) Patrols. - Sergeants, head constables or constables, shall be employed to watch from the footpath or side of the road at particular points, or along particular stretches of road, with a view to checking contraventions of the rules framed by Government under the Motor Vehicles Act, and all other traffic rules, local or general. Police Officers so employed shall ordinarily content themselves, in the case of motor vehicles, with noting the number of an offending vehicle. They shall endeavour to stop and take particulars of offending vehicles other than motor vehicles and, if circumstances permit their stepping into the middle of the road sufficiently far ahead of a motor vehicle to give the driver thereof a clear signal to stop, they may do so, but, in no circumstances shall any attempt be made to direct traffic by means of signals given from the side of the road. Notes taken by patrols working under this rule shall be reported on return to the police station concerned, and subsequent action for the issue of formal warnings or for prosecution shall be taken under the orders of the Superintendent of Police. Traffic points, beats and patrols shall be closely supervised by head constables and, where available, sergeants mounted on cycles. (2) On occasions such as fairs, public ceremonies, race-meetings and the like, when traffic is heavily congested on particular roads for a limited period, special police arrangements shall be made in accordance with the circumstances of each case, lines of constables being posted if necessary to direct different classes of traffic into different streams or along particular routes. On such occasions full use shall be made of special direction posts; notices in the Press and other methods of informing the public of the regulations to be observed. (3) All police officers on beat or patrol duty shall act according to the principles prescribed for traffic patrols in sub-rule (1) above in connection with contraventions of traffic regulations occurring within their view. (4) Vehicles shall not be stopped for interrogation at cross roads or in a manner liable to interfere with the free flow of other traffic. When it is necessary to examine licences, and make enquiries the driver concerned shall be directed to move his vehicle to a position indicated by the police officer, where other traffic will not be impeded. Checking of permits and tokens, registration numbers, correctness of lighting equipment, etc., can be done to a great extent when vehicles are standing in parks. (5) In exercise of the powers conferred on them by section 31 of the Police Act, police officers on traffic duty shall require pedestrians to keep to the footpaths, or, where such do not exist, to the side of the road and shall prevent them from causing obstruction and danger to other classes of traffic. (6) Police officers on traffic duty are required to have a thorough knowledge of the neighbourhood and to be able to direct enquirers by the appropriate route to any area in Railway Police and other Special Rules 817 that neighbourhood, or to important points such as railway stations, post offices and other principal public buildings. Police Officers on such duty must on no account whatever allow themselves to be provoked into losing control of their tempers, or into the use of discourteous language. They must remain firm but polite at all times, and, while answering reasonable enquiries clearly and concisely, shall abstain from argument of all sorts and shall be on their guard against being distracted from attention to their duty by becoming involved in conversation.

To ensure observance of these regulations, the Superintendent of Police is authorized, with the approval of the District Magistrate, to require the active assistance of local authorities in providing stands at suitable places, at which hackney carriages and public motor vehicles may wait for hirers, and parking spaces for private vehicles in congested business areas and in the neighbourhood of places of public resort. The regulation of public motor vehicle and hackney carriage stands is provided for by rules framed under the Motor Vehicles and Hackney Carriage Acts. (2) Arrangements for parking private motor vehicles must be accommodated to the circumstances of the place or occasion and the dimensions of, and nature of approaches to, the available parking space. The following general rules shall, however, be observed:(a) Separate parks shall be arranged for motor and horse-drawn vehicles. (b) In parks for motor vehicles, unattended vehicles shall be parked separately from those with attendants, and special arrangements shall be made for the former to be watched to prevent pilferage or wanton damage. (c) Strict control shall be exercised over entry and departure of vehicles to and from parks, and sufficient police shall be provided to ensure this and to prevent blocks and disorder. (d) Whenever possible, separate arrival and departure routes shall be prescribed for motor and horse-drawn vehicles, respectively or they shall be kept in separate streams. (e) Whenever possible, the entrances and exists of a park shall be separate and, where congestion is liable to occur owing to arrivals and departures taking place simultaneously, departing vehicles shall not be allowed to cross those arriving. (f) For parking at night, at balls, cinema theatres etc., it is advisable to enforce the duplicate ticket system described in sub-rule (4) below. (3) For state occasions and important public functions special additional arrangements are necessary in order to secure the rapid and orderly evacuation of parks. In addition to the sub-divisions of parks prescribed in sub-rule (2) above, space must be set aside (a) for the carriages or motor cars of Their Excellencies the Viceroy, the Commander-in-Chief and the Governor if attending the function, and such other vehicles as are required to arrive and depart with them, (b) for the vehicles of Indian Ruling Chiefs and such staff as is required to arrive and depart with them. This park must be arranged in the order of departure of the Chiefs, which is invariably the exact reverse of the order of arrival, (c) for a special park for the vehicles of those high officials to whom, under general or special orders, \"special park\" labels have been issued in advance, conferring the privilege of arriving after and leaving before the general public. No vehicle shall be allowed to leave the general parks, till all vehicles in categories (a), (b) and (c) above have been cleared. (4) On all occasions of the nature referred to in sub-rule (3) above, parking arrangements shall be carefully worked out well in advance; on occasions of major importance the arrangements made shall be fully rehearsed. On such occasions it is essential to ar818 Punjab Police Rules, 1934 Volume 3, CHAPTER 28 range adequate arrival and departure platforms where a number of vehicles can set down and take up passengers simultaneously. The practice, which is permissible on informal occasions, of allowing the public to find their own vehicles in the parks, should not be followed, but numbered tickets in duplicate should be issued on arrival to the owners and drivers of vehicles. The vehicles shall be parked according to these numbers, and called up by the police officers at the departure platforms as the duplicate number tickets are handed to them, owners of unattended vehicles being allowed to fetch their vehicles from the park allotted to them to the departure platform to pick up their passengers.

Whenever it is decided to make an enquiry under clause (a) or clause (b) of rule 22, the District Magistrate or other Magistrate appointed as aforesaid or the Magistrate deputed under clause (b) of rule 22, as the case may be, shall proceed to the scene of the accident and conduct the enquiry there, and shall at once advise the Agent or Manager of the railway and the Government Inspector by telegraph of the date and hour at which the enquiry will commence, so as to enable the railway administration to summon the requisite expert evidence. 24. A Magistrate, making an enquiry under Rule 22, may summon any railway servant, and any other person whose presence he may think necessary, and, after taking the evidence and completing the enquiry, shall if he considers there are sufficient grounds for a judicial enquiry, take the requisite steps for bringing to trial any person whom he may consider to be criminally liable for the accident. Whenever technical points are involved, 826 Punjab Police Rules, 1934 Volume 3, CHAPTER 28 the Magistrate should call for the opinion of the Government Inspector or other professional persons. 25. The result of every enquiry or investigation made under rule 22 shall be communicated by the Magistrate to the Agent or Manager of the Railway and to the Government Inspector. 26. If, in the course of any judicial enquiry, into an accident occurring in the course of working a railway, the Magistrate desires the assistance of the Government Inspector or of the Agent or Manager of the railway, or the attendance of any officer of the railway, to explain any matter relating to railway supervision, management or working, he will issue a requisition to the Agent or Manager for the attendance at court of an officer competent to explain such matter, stating at the same time the nature of the assistance required. In summoning railway servants, the Magistrate will take care not to summon so large a number of the employees, especially of one class, on the same day, as to cause inconvenience to the working of the railway. In the case of very serious accidents it will generally be advisable for the Magistrate to obtain a report, from both the Government Inspector and the Agent or Manager of the railway, in regard to the accident, before finally concluding the judicial enquiry. 27.

(3) Under the standing order of the High Court, Superintendents of Police are entitled to peruse the judicial record in all cases where a police officer is convicted or, though acquitted, is left under suspicion or censured. The object of this is to enable departmental action to be taken where necessary. Copies of judgments, and translations of the same where necessary, in such cases, will be supplied free of charge. The Inspector-General of Police or any Deputy Inspector-General may, on giving rea778 Punjab Police Rules, 1934 Volume 3, CHAPTER 27 sons, call for the record of any decided case, in which the police are affected. Unless there are grave reasons to the contrary, in which case the Sessions Judge will decide the point, the request will be complied with. The Inspector-General of Police has a right to call for the records in all cases of professional crime. Courts are required to send to the Inspector-General of Police for record copies of such confessions as may be of value of the police. All modifications of original decisions made in appeal, revision or reference are required to be communicated by the District Magistrate to the prosecuting branch of the office of Superintendent of Police. (Rule 3, Chapter 11-E, of Volume III, HIgh Court Rules and Orders). Copies of judgments and depositions required by police officers in the course of their duties are exempted from the charges authorized under the Court Fees Act, but not from copying fees. Gazetted officers and all prosecuting inspectors and prosecuting sub-inspectors, within the limits of their jurisdiction as public prosecutors (rule 27.4) can obtain, free of all charges copies of any part of the record of a case which they may require in their capacity as public prosecutor, the cost being met by District Magistrates or the courts concerned. With the exceptions noted above, police officers are not entitled either to have original judicial records handed over to them for perusal or to obtain copies free of charge. On the frequent occasions when it is necessary for a Superintendent of Police, in the discharge of his duties, to study the evidence and decisions recorded at a trial, the proper channel for obtaining access to such records is through the authority of the District Magistrate. The latter is head of the prosecuting agency, of which the Superintendent of Police is in direct charge, and that agency requires constant access to judicial records, in order to fulfil its duty of assisting the District Magistrate through the Superintendent of Police, to keep in close touch with the work of magistrates’ courts and the results of cases. When a perusal of the original record will suffice, copies should be dispensed with, as fees for them have to be paid in every case, whether from police or judicial funds. It is the practice of the High Court to print the proceedings in all cases in which the death sentence is inflicted, and it is sometimes possible in such cases to obtain spare copies of the printed records on application, through the Deputy Inspector-General of Police, Criminal Investigation Department, to the Registrar of High Court.
