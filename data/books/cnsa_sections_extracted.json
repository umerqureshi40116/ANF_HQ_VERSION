(2) The High Court to which an application is made under sub-section (1) may issue an evidence-gathering order or a search warrant under this sub-section,\nwhere it is satisfied that there are reasonable grounds to believe that- (a) an offence has been committed, or is suspected on reasonable\ngrounds to have been committed against the laws of the requesting\nState which, if committed in Pakistan, would have constituted an\noffence under this Act; (b) evidence of the commission of the foreign offence or information that\nwould reveal the whereabouts of a person who is suspected of\ncommitting the foreign offence is likely to be found in a building,\nreceptacle or place in Pakistan; and (c) in the case of an application for a search warrant, it would not, in all the\ncircumstances, be more appropriate to grant an evidence-gathering\norder. (3) An evidence-gathering order- (a) shall provide for the manner in which the evidence is to be obtained in\norder to give proper effect to the foreign request unless prohibited\nunder the law of Pakistan, and in particular, may require any person\nnamed therein to- (i) make a record from data or make a copy of a record;\n(ii) attend Court to give evidence on oath or otherwise until\nexcused; and\n(iii) produce to the High Court or to any person designated by the\nCourt, anything, including any record, or copy thereof; and (b) may include such terms and conditions as the High Court considers\ndesirable, including those relating to the interests of the person named\ntherein or of third party. (4) A person named in an evidence-gathering order may refuse to answer\na question or to produce a record or thing where the refusal is based on- (a) a law in force in Pakistan; (b) a privilege recognized by a law in force in the foreign State that made\nthe request; or (c) a law in force in the foreign State that would render the answering of\nthat question or the production of that record or thing by that person in\nits own jurisdiction an offence. (5) Where a person refuses to answer a question or to produce a record or\nthing under sub-section (4) , the High Court shall report the matter to the Federal\nGovernment which shall notify to the foreign State accordingly and request it to\nprovide a written statement on whether the person’s refusal was well-founded under\nthe law of the foreign State.

(8) The High Court may issue a warrant for the arrest of a person named\nin an evidence-gathering order where it is satisfied that the person- (a) did not attend or remain in attendance as required or is about to\nabscond; and (b) was personally served with the order. (9) A person arrested in pursuance of a warrant issued under sub-section (8) shall be forthwith brought before the High Court, to ensure compliance with the\norder made under sub-section (2) , and the Court may order that the person be\ndetained in custody or released on recognizance, with or without sureties.

(11) The person executing a search warrant issued under sub-section (2) - (a) may seize anything that he believes on reasonable grounds will afford\nevidence of, or has been obtained for, or used in, or is intended to be\nused in, the commission of an offence under this Act; (b) shall, at least five days before the time of the hearing to consider its\nexecution, file in the High Court a written report concerning the\nexecution of the warrant, including a description of the records or\nthings seized. (12) At the hearing to consider the execution of a search warrant the High\nCourt, after considering any representation made by the Director-General or an\nofficer authorized by him, or any person from whom a record or thing was seized\npursuant to the warrant, and any person who claims to have an interest in the record\nor thing, may- (a) order that the record or thing be returned to the person from whom it\nwas seized, or to the person lawfully entitled to its possession, if\nsatisfied that the warrant was not executed according to its terms and\nthat it would be in the public interest to so return it; (b) in any other case, order that the record or thing be send to the foreign\nState, and include in the order such terms and conditions as the High\nCourt considers necessary- (i) to give effect to the request from foreign State;\n(ii) with respect to the preservation and return to Pakistan of any\nrecord or thing seized; or\n(iii) with respect to the interest of a third party.
